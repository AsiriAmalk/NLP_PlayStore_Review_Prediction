0	3	a	This theme is very nyc.
1	4	a	Blink as an app is stuck on the authentication page!! I'm sure once all the bugs are figured out. The app itself will experience better reviews.
2	5	a	"There's a possible loophole in expertise mayb in all of the stages of sudoku but it's CHEATIN I've not tried it so I'm not 100% sure I just had a quick look, when u come out of the game it shows u the box with the numbers that you've already done so if u want 2 CHEAT or need a helpin hand mayb 4 1 number try it, it's not really winin but that's my opinion, I'm gonna do my best not 2 CHEAT, \but never say never\"" Good luck.  ;)"""
3	1	a	I have Internet and every thing works like a charm but this game and If you could of just made this game offline it might of actually been successful and that makes people not want to get ur other games
4	4	a	Nice! But updates intermittently. Love the looks though.
5	2	a	App is ok but loads extremely extremely slow
6	5	a	Yo passed my learners thanks to this app !!! Yassss🙌
7	1	a	The app does not work with my phone, a Motorola Moto e5 Supra. The camera \nis extremely dark and underexposed, and cannot scan the cards. This is \nreally frustrating.
8	5	a	truly big , thanks,  ;)
9	5	a	My favorite halloween wallpaper! Used it for 2 years.. Great features and choice of background.  Fun to mix it up.  Great job creators!!
10	5	a	First app I've ever rated because it's the best. Looking forward to Magnus next year already. Hope Vishy is there too.
11	3	a	Server connection problem.. automatic searching for a ling time.. nothing workss. if luck favour it connects.. also there's a keyboard typing problem.. all text not showing what I am typing.. please fix these problems and I will give you 5 stars or  6 stars if you want :P... Btw this is a great idea :) thanks

13	5	a	Awsummm game , loved itt :-D  Great work :-)
14	5	a	Great RPG. I have been playing it off and on for years. Never gets old.
15	4	a	it would be extremely hard with no walkthroughs on line.  this android app it is hard to see many of the images for example the numbers in  the flying wing cockpit. the vital clues are most hidden by the action buttons, some passes are not always visible and it crashed many times
16	5	a	Just to let u know it's going to be extremely hard to controll so set sensitivity very low and I found it easier to use tilt
17	1	a	Its a worst car parking game that's I played in my life by download this game I wasted by data
18	4	a	Muy buena app, sólo mejoría el hecho de que no se puede elegir el recibir o no notificaciones. Por todo lo demás me parece excelente.

29	1	a	Estava jogando numa boa e mandando muito bem, derrepente o jogo parou de funcionar, tento entrar nele e fica só na primeira tela de todas no LOADING completa o load e de lá não sai.  Testei tanto online como offline.    Uma pena, baita jogo!

31	5	a	I'm a pro at this and on the updates ID like you to add more rims and then let us do different stuff like suspension and traction
32	5	a	I really like this app its easier to transfer pictures from Canon to smartphones and it doesn't take a long time for you to transfer!!! No more memory cards or card readers!!! Wifi connection will do!! Great job!!👍👏
33	4	a	Easy to use and does not let kids into things you do not approve.
34	4	a	i just download.  liked the graphics
35	1	a	Stupid I even saw the reviews and i even thought why not!!!!!BUT NOW I SEE WHY NOT!!!
36	5	a	Beautiful app! Thanks for app!
37	5	a	Cool did anyone else noticed it's like dragon ball z
38	2	a	IT'S BEEN LIKE OVER 2 MONTHS, FIX THE DARN THING ALREADY!!!  Everything is SO ridiculously small that it's unusable....  would have been 4.5* if displayed enough to function~  Now, dev could easily do a quick fix and provide an update but nope....  instead ignores it and all the complaints.

50	5	a	I needed an app to enter the latitude longitude all of my lost mavic Pro drone. One that would direct me to where it ran out of power. This fits the bill 100%. why is it that I had to search so hard to find an app that would allow me to put in latitude and longitude and find the place to which I was seeking. Congrats too this app maker. what a Jewel. I don't look for other things like prices hotels Etc just using it to find my drone if I lose it again thank you again!
51	5	a	Keno is my favorite game in the casino.  So hard to win.  I get my Keno fix with this app.
52	3	a	"Nice look and feel. But weather update has never worked for me. Always \request failed\""..."""
53	4	a	OK I like this app..but I wish it was some way we can use multiple photos on one video. Like when I put a photo on one thing..and click photo..it just sit on top of the last photo.Also when you mess up on a text.. you can't go and edit that text..you have to delete it and start all over.I think if someone use more than one photo, the video should animate all of them and no just  one and have photos laying on the top of each other
54	1	a	Waste app do not download it and waste of internet
55	5	a	It was the best game 😘😎😍😀🙌
56	3	a	Poor on dimming and very small font
57	3	a	My original review was pretty harsh. My apologies. I've used this app a bit more, and it's not bad. However, I lean more towards the mobile version because it's a flat price and I don't feel it's worth a monthly sub (on pc). Uploading maps and minis DOES work, you just need a really good device to do so, otherwise you could spend a few hours trying (as I have. I'm persistent.) I do recommend this for RPG tabletop gamers.
58	5	a	Rugi sapa tidak download. Terima kasih ilmunya admin
59	1	a	Keeps closing down 'app stopped working' on inputting a new destination?? Useless.
60	1	a	Are you color blind this is blue. Make a dark material theme that is actually purple please
61	1	a	This whole game is sick and very wrong.
62	4	a	It's very useful app for learn english I think u should try this app if you want to speak n learn english
63	5	a	Nice launcher except the background are too light for me, but I like the way the icon look. The design and color are soft and easy to the eye. I installed it and just change to use my own darker gray background like every other launcher. Its beautiful!
64	5	a	This is the best live interactive wallpaper I have come across
65	3	a	Great app and others too but needed some apps in english
66	3	a	"Não consigo comprar ingressos no aplicativo porque ele diz que \Somente a troca de ingresso Super Saver está habilitada neste aplicativo\"". Continua sendo útil pra consultar os horários dos filmes."""
67	5	a	This game is great and it teaches how to park a car,I recommend downloading it but can't you add another city and other cars like lambo
68	5	a	Awesome game interesting to play

My grandfather would always say \if you want to know what the weather is look outside your window because those weather reporters are never going to tell you the truth.\""  Well with Raindar you don't have to wait to see the weather outside your windows to know if it's rain or shine.  I love this app."""
72	5	a	I picked this up off my friend Darrin's phone after a 20-year hiatus and immediately scored a 1:37.  Just like old times.
73	2	a	Not a nice app there should be some more information
74	3	a	I would really like to be able to pay to not have ads show up for this app. They are uncalled for.
75	3	a	I love this game... it is so addictive! Really wish I could give it 5 stars, but as others have observed, if you turn the music off, it doesn't STAY off! Also, it's extremely frustrating to reach say, level 4, and not be able to save your progress to pick up where you left off later. Instead, you have to start all over, from the beginning, the next time you play... grrr! Please fix these two things, and I will come back and give it that 5 star rating, because this game really is a lot of fun!
76	3	a	The game plays well but the text is too small when showing hands played. No list of bonus payout. It would also be better to show movement of chips when betting, winning and loosing. Also doesnt take out 5% comission like in real play.
77	3	a	Need to be updated not working
78	3	a	1 Star because in 2018 it is still not Chromecast compatible. I would absolutely love to see all of the NFB archives but not on my phone. Until then I'll continue watching via a third party and most likely unauthorized Kodi addon. Do better!

84	4	a	Muy bueno. Hace falta mas piropos
85	4	a	Great widget. However, it sometimes fails to show real strength of signal unless the phone is put off and on.
86	5	a	I love it Location not updated in my 2 phone
87	5	a	Does what it says on the tin!
88	2	a	I'm having trouble with the game today I Can't log on to it...Why someone fix the problem with this game.After I updated the game it started to give me trouble
89	1	a	I thought this app would show you how to decorate the cakes. It's just a bunch of pictures :(
90	4	a	Great app, the live bus data is hit and miss though, a bus has been there in front of me, but not on the map. It needs to be 100% accurate or it's pointless to have it. Overall though, good app. Thanks.
91	5	a	I like it a lot    the best game to play  by helen doman i love it so much
92	2	a	This game was entertaining. But the file size is huge. Worse than that, I now am awakened by alerts on my phone marketing related games.  This morning it was at 6am.  For me, personally, I don't care how fun a game may be, if it wakes me up to send advertisements, it's not worth it. There are too many other great games available. This one is now uninstalled.
93	5	a	It's  only with this app I can read movies with the app of my choice when I plug my usb SD CARD reader in the phone. Really do the job!
94	2	a	Até as consultas são pagas. Quando há apps e sites mobile dos bancos que funcionam bem, pura e simplesmente não compensa.
95	1	a	What I want is to be able to use the brilliant user interface of N7 to play music files that I have stored on my Synology UPNP server through my network. What I get is an buggy, unintuative, part foreign add-on to N7 which allows N7 to send music files to other UPNP devices! I only find that out AFTER I have paid for it! Like I said - Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! I know that it has a UPNP player built in, but the user interface it offers is extremely poor and practically unuseable. It's hard to see how these two apps could have come from the same developer! I would uninstall it except that I've paid for it!
96	3	a	Unfortunately it won't load past the Unity screen on my HTC One M9. I read another review with the same problem but the fix was a factory reset which, seems a tad extreme. I would love to play it and will check back for a fix.
97	3	a	I feel like I'm going in circles. I can't find anywhere new...I would rate it four stars but I'm rating 3. It is because its hard to find where to go, plus! Its hard to maneuver the controls. Also the only time the ghost girl was active was when she quickly passes the hallways... Buuuuut overall scary and creepy game. Ugh I just had to add, their are TOO MANY dead ends.
98	5	a	ITS NOT BORING SO SHUT UP. Its also more unfair than Minecraft because you need ilands premium to make new worlds! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Devs plz let people make ilands for free
99	4	a	Make it better don't just cling to the original idea ie think out of the box
100	2	a	The Always Remember Me game is amazing and story is relatable, has nice art work too. The only downside is you guys make the free play part so limited then have to pay for the rest. It's really sad that you have to do that to people who enjoy the game. Why not make some games pay then use the profits to make a free-to-play game for people who aren't able to purchase and/or for loyal players.
101	5	a	It used to have  waaaayyyyyyy more to choose from!!  Now it just has a fraction!!!!
102	5	a	Simple, runs well (how could it not?) and of course FUN! My only small gripe is that the cubes rotate with the camera, making it tough to find obvious solutions sometimes, and I say this knowing it could have been deliberately designed that way to avoid being too easy.
103	1	a	It's a very low quality game with pretty poor gameplay. It gets boring in about 5 secs.
104	5	a	Cute and easy game for us
105	4	a	This is the best word search I've ever played. I'd give it five stars if it \nweren't for the repetitive words. Some words show up over and over, puzzle \nafter puzzle and it gets kinda irritating. But it's a plain and simple word \nsearch, no extra bells and whistles and that's what I like most about it 😊
106	2	a	I have the same problem with trying to sign on.  There is no option to set up an account so the app is useless until this is fixed.  Running this on a Samsung Note 4.
107	5	a	Just works, and saves hauling the baby monitor arround when travelling!
108	3	a	This game would pass IF you’d fix the bugs. You have LARGE issues with the lasers not behaving as defined causing a number of levels to be impassable. Tsk, tsk!
109	5	a	Its app very help full

Dont understand why the owner dont fix it???? If it stay working, i will give u a 5*, but for now, if u hv a negative * rating, i will pick it! Anyway, thanks for the good work on previous version. Enjoy that.

134	5	a	It's easy to use and the downloaded tracks go straight into your music library. I was skeptical at first because of the hypnosis part, but it actually works really well!

Thank you for making this game I love it this game is really fun I like it that you get to roam everywhere thank you for making this game PS,Deon😎😘 peace and goodwill😃
146	5	a	I love this app! I use it every day. Its simplicity, is perfect. The colors are quiet, and conducive to meditation, the prayers accurate. It couldn't be any better! Thank you!
147	5	a	Well done and super fun. Great way to pass time waiting in line or on a bus ride without internet!  Great job Tomek!
148	5	a	It's cool though. i like it cox it helps me with my dreams interpretation
149	3	a	Been using blacklist for ages, still a great app and blocks all my calls without me even knowing about it but from the original it's now full of ad's and requires xposed framework to block sms (on lollipop) it all depends on your phone model I've had blacklist on several phones including the PLAY, ARC, M and now S4 and never had a problem but a relative has it on the E and it barely works as for the malware reports it's most likely a false positive with the operation it uses to block sms (assumption)
150	5	a	Very happy to see this game..
151	5	a	Looks good on my droid 4.
152	3	a	App is useful IF your phone has a seperate menu button. If it doesn't you can't access the settings so you can't configure it to sort the needed items on top. Which makes it very cumbersome to use.
153	1	a	I can't rate it if it crashes just trying to open it. I'm guessing that it would have sucked.
154	5	a	But please make other nember and new song pack like Miracle In December ans Overdose please. I am looking forward.. thank in advance

169	4	a	The new update is really spectacular! It is quite user friendly and the graphics are a nice touch. The only complaint I have is that every time the app is updated, I have to uninstall and reinstall to log in. This problem is usually a one time issue after an update. If you were to fix this problem then the new updated app would be worthy of 5 stars.

Extremely worth the buy and my childhood is relived again! Thanks so much seriously.

202	1	a	So far I have nothing but horrible experience with his company. When it comes setting trainee with competent lead trainer crst fail  miserable. I wouldn't recommend to anyone.
203	2	a	How to use this app?   Always say unfortunately Go contacts theme has stop...
204	5	a	I love this game I suggest you that you can download this game if you have speed and in this game it is easy to collect money and  k coin
205	1	a	same thing over and over nothing changes there is no challeges is to dull.... good graphics but boring game.... id like a refund please!!!!
206	5	a	Fun little game. Only costed around a buck. Slight learning curve at the beginning. Read instructions. It is a fun puzzle game.
207	4	a	اتمنى تحسين البرنامج للأفضل وقلة الدعاية بها
208	1	a	I played the clarient for one year now and this is so easyer than really playing it u won't know how to play a clarient with this trust me!
209	3	a	quite fun but need a better alliances feature.
210	5	a	make more face reactions of this sticker
211	5	a	I like it. Fun, and I can pass the time in Doctors visit, automotive repair shops or anywhere I have to wait. Good game.
212	5	a	отличная программа, приятный интерфейс, нет рекламы
213	5	a	Nice it's very usefull apk
214	4	a	I might give it 5 stars after I upgrade . . .
215	1	a	When I try to touch it it just free you don't want to get it or at least fix it please
216	5	a	Should update number of new mobile operators
217	5	a	This game is awesome to me!😇
218	1	a	This app is useless unless you pay for each effect separately. Other than that you downloaded an app to simply record your voice which any smartphone can do anyway. Waste of time. And I'm sure the effects are just as disappointing as the initial download. But you can't tell if it's worth it cuz you don't even get to try it to see if you like it enough to pay for it.
219	1	a	Jaisa khete h besa nahi hai बाद game
220	1	a	I hate this app i cant find a word to discribe it
221	5	a	I literally mean that but excellent time waster
222	2	a	Nice design but it finds no houses, despite there being loads in Donegal for sale
223	4	a	the ■s creep me out. Take it out and I'll be fine. By■ I mean the one with eyes.
224	3	a	Aplikacija cesto zakoci koristim s9 plus tako da nije do telefona
225	1	a	Srsly is this wat u call an educational app ... Everything abt this app is bad !!!
226	5	a	Fine and i uded to test ntk route.
227	5	a	It's game is very nice good
228	5	a	I love this game. It introduced me to the genre and has kept me hooked since. I have played through it to the point of memorization. I told the story of one of my playthroughs to my younger sibling as a bed time story. This is an amazing read and well worth the cost.
229	5	a	ممتاز ومميز .. ونتطلع للمزيد من التحسينات.
230	1	a	almost all features are download or pay
231	3	a	No its bad i in blahh
232	1	a	All I see is a blank screen with the ads at the bottom of the screen. :( I really wanted this to work cause I want to be able to serial conect to switches to manage them. Dev, please test on 1024x600 screen and if you list contact info on app description I'll contact you.
233	2	a	Everything works fine except when I type in korean on a search bar in any sites in my browser (chrome). For example, I go in chrome and go to yahoo and type something korean in the search bar, it comes out like:  안ㅕㅕ하ㅎ요ㅇ When I'm trying to type: 안녕하세요. (Not because I type wrong, it just comes out like that) PLEASE. Fix this.  Everything else works fine.. And I do have the current pro version of al type keyboard..
234	3	a	Gives you a lil bit of what it would be like to trip but not the same. Lsd is way more intense than the few seconds you get from the app.
235	5	a	Best collage app I've ever download. So easy to use. I can even edit invitation cards and souvenir's labels just using my phone because of your wonderful app. Thank you...😊
236	5	a	واحد من البرامج المفيدة جدا ... شكرا و موفق
237	5	a	I like the app just needs a few adjustments.
238	1	a	كنت اريد مسلسل معين لكن لم اجده بل لقد وجدت اشياء اخرى
239	4	a	It's is very helpful for people who can't use money wisely, for example... like me
240	5	a	Very intresting, I want more games in this game.
241	1	a	Once you try it is very confusing!
242	5	a	So... trendy ui, ultra simple idea, must be mind-blowing, right?  Well...  Great fun for dozens and dozens of seconds.  It really is fun, too, no joke.  But after a couple minutes, it's time to move on.  Five star because free with no ads.  So it's worth much more than I paid.  Try it, just don't believe the hype.
243	5	a	Alhamdulillah aplikasi ini sangat bermanfaat.....                                           mohon text bahasa arab-nya di perjelas,lebih baiknya lagi dengan beberapa imam,di jelaskan cara berqiro'at-nya.seperti qiroa'h sab'ah dan lain sebagainya        tingkatkanlah....................!!! Semoga aplikasi ini membawa keberkahan........Aamiiin
244	4	a	Would be nice to have instructions. As another person stated, it opens up as you play. More options pop up, and more abilities. I almost stopped playing because I thought it was boring. Thank goodness I kept playing, cuz the more you do, the more you can do. DEVS I'D MAKE IT MORE CLEAR THAT THE GAME OPENS UP AS U PLAY! Prob keep more players playing that way! Need some work, but good game, all in all.
245	3	a	This game somehow fails to make you feel like you're increasing in skill - collisions, especially during some longer stage camera transformations like the 'flip', often feel inevitable or just a matter of luck. In a brutal arcade game where every millisecond and input is crucial, this feeling, whether a result of actual mechanical flaws, poor level structure, or just a failure in feedback, is deal-breaking and results in a lack of motivation to keep playing and improving.
246	5	a	It does what I'm looking for better than the rest - real time state of each processor.
247	5	a	To be fair to play with others in the game you must be nice to others.
248	5	a	This app is perfect for everyone, clear and easy to use.
249	2	a	As the title says, needs to be updated for current android versions and configurations.
250	4	a	Much improved and now quite functional.
251	1	a	Tried it on my Moto 4g and Samsung tablet and it crashed on opening on both.  Uninstalled
252	5	a	I like it... can`t say the same about the tablet though
253	2	a	This is nothing more than a very rough guide and prone to gross inaccuracies It told me yesterday my heart rate was 0 I was effectively dead!!!
254	5	a	Dirshit sharma says when i open this game i will see this game is perfect \ngame for kids
255	4	a	I tried to download it 5 times, but now i'm using it and it's kinda good.
256	5	a	this is awsome cuz it's well one of my FAVORITE songs, but can you make a endstone app you know   the song from thebajancanadian of youtube. PLZ??
257	5	a	IF YOU WANT TO EXSPRESS YOUR FEELINGS TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND /BOYFRIEND, OR JUST ANYONE YOU LOVE...PLEASE DOWNLOAD THIS APP. ITS BEAUTIFUL!! IT HAS BREATHTAKING SAYINGS WITH SUCH BEAUTIFUL PICTURES!! PLUS YOU CAN SAVE THE ONES YOU LIKE  IN YOUR PHONE AND SEND AS MANY AS YOU LIKE FROM THE APP.TO ANYONE!! IF I COULD I'D GIVE IT MORE THAN 5 STARS!! DOWNLOAD NOW!!!
258	3	a	I expected the widget to either launch the stock calendar app or launch \nsome calendar. It did neither. I now have a widget on my screen that shows \nthe current date (which I wanted) but no content. I'm on a Samsung phone. \nWhat's the deal?!
259	3	a	Mobile deposit is very slow and won't work sometimes.
260	4	a	One of the best themes
261	3	a	Recently I was playing a match where in the 1st innings I gave near about 150runs lead to opposition. In 2nd innings, when I was bowling, I took all the 10wickets within 60runs. But after taking 10wickets the game still remains continue. Now the score is showing 80/19. I have screenshots. If you want please provide me mail id. I shall send the screenshots.
262	3	a	It used to be a great app ever since the updates I can no longer watch the videos. Also noticed the stories are usually 2 -10 days old I will keep it hopes that it will get better like it use to be a couple years back.
263	1	a	It do not work with note 3.I was very happy with when it work  on my Galaxy S3..get it to work with my note 3
264	1	a	Such a third class app  It just shows an option of working in rooted devices..
265	3	a	The default camera had a silent shutter mode, so besides the effects don't need this camera.
266	5	a	I love it I love reeding
267	5	a	This game is the best yet as far as match/puzzle.  I absolutely love it! Great job whoever thought this up. But is there any way to turn off the music n still have the game sounds? Love the graphics n sounds...I will give it 100 stars !!! This is THE BEST game!! Been playing awhile now n never get bored with it...just wish there was a separate control button to turn off music n just have sound effects...
268	1	a	Does not even work properly, bugs everywhere, very bad interface, can't scroll down, can't close menu... I could go indefinetly...
269	4	a	Less forecast.its will be better if 7 days foretaste
270	1	a	At first this was a great plug in, but now it wants to be the default msg app. And if you don't allow it to be the default it still shows the text in the main app. Fix this please.
271	5	a	This is a good app
272	2	a	I am best my theme is best
273	3	a	There is a bug in the app where the icon on screen keeps crashing and I have to manually go to settings and reactivate it...please rectify it or else you may loose your user base...
274	3	a	" the app crashes. Please fix this problem or I will uninstall the app."""
275	5	a	Such an awesome game it's fun and challenging. Just what  I  like  in a game.
276	1	a	this is the worst ever game
277	3	a	It needs a redo button. The holes are stupid long. When you get so far buried in a hole you shouldn't have to wait to restart. The depth perception is terrible. Hitting the ball into a corner, just to find out there is a massive drop, is annoying. The physics at the edges of the hole do not match the physics next to the cup. I can see the shadow in the hole....but no drop. I am done until next update.
278	1	a	I can't buy the music and pictures
279	5	a	I am new in my region and this app help me to find a house to my family! Thanks a lot! God bless you!
280	1	a	"Whenever I install, it gives me error saying \couldn't install it on USB storage or memory card\"" plz fix"""
281	5	a	Good job. Works very well.
282	1	a	First game I ever played that it got easier at you advanced through the levels. Transmission wouldn't shift all the time. Couldn't smash over a port a potty but some buildings could be driven through.
283	1	a	Keeps saving the the first image when you load new photos
284	5	a	Works well on my moto X. The grandkids took my phone and have had a blast! And I love the big bang theory show.
285	5	a	uhmmm plss make different color of go sms like go sms black.. please edpecially ung pang EMO
286	1	a	Hey team, After 1 week use it's shows as chain validation failed.couldn't access anything.please rectify this ASAP.
287	3	a	Ñ é ruim, mas está longe de ser bom.
288	5	a	Best skin I have found so far. Great work and please try to add different colors.
289	1	a	i don't like this it just wastes my storage
290	5	a	اذا كنت تبحث عن برنامج دقيق % 100 هذا هو لا تدور غيره. باختصار شغل محترفين جزى الله القائمين عليه الف خير
291	4	a	I love all of the Graal's,  even though I only play 2. Classic I have over 8500+ hours,  on here I have 153, now to the problem. When I look on my map it shows know body,  including friends. It only show people with bounties on them. Fix this problem and I'll rate 5 🌟
292	4	a	Have tried several but this one my fav and will only play this kind. BUT Hints cost WAY too much.
293	4	a	A great total solution on your home..
294	1	a	Waste of time to use this app😏
295	5	a	It is a funny game
296	4	a	At first learning the game dynamic seemed hard but after playing a while it came pretty easy. Overall this is a good game packed with an interesting plot line. Finished in a few hours just wish there was more.
297	1	a	Sta ste uradili sa aplikacijom..... Ni jednu sliku u pocetnom meniju nece da ucita...
298	4	a	App is cool but Maybe something like multiplayer and more cities. Then it won't be so boring when your the only one out there on your own.
299	4	a	Le falta poder descargar el mapa offline . Pero bueno
300	4	a	I like to play this game
301	5	a	I want to sex you my need hot
302	2	a	Many laggings and bad control of ships, Wayy too many enemies for No upgradable ships or bombs..!!?? ?? Of all comments Zero response from makers ..they don't care it seems..too bad..good game though..!
303	5	a	I love being able to edit and  post works great for me
304	3	a	Appli très lente, il faut mieux utiliser une autre appli
305	5	a	Love it! And it's true that once you understand the rules you could overcome the I.A. but it's not that easy. Who said the I.A. always koi-koi was wrong, never happened to me. It 'shoubu' (show down) at the exact moments to beat you and only koi-koi if it could obviously gain more points. It's fun and challenging, not rigged!
306	1	a	Not working for ma phone
307	1	a	This is the worst game I've ever downloaded! I don't suggest it to no-one!
308	5	a	Never miss a shot fumbling with phone settings! One click wonder.  Galaxy ace. Thanks
309	5	a	When I go into the county app it doesn't respond . Just loads. Can't open exit 83 n york rd.
310	4	a	Don't get me wrong. I Love the game,but when I go to collect my bounse it tells me to be connected. I always am,second when I g to watch videos for the free stones I don't get anything.
311	5	a	I always use this launcher even when I buy new smartphone, I always looking for this... A big thanks to the developer.. Highly recommended!
312	5	a	I never play such a realistic air battel game .i like it so much that i have downloaded its all three parts.can you plese tell me the date of new version of this game fox one survival mode is launched .i am crazy about this game .so pls tell me.waiting for ur answer
313	4	a	" I'll rate this five stars instead of four."""
314	3	a	"Please make RUMP steak live wallpaper \please!!!"""
315	5	a	A nice widget for countdown of days.
316	4	a	It Is a fun time killing game, but... I do agree with most reviewes who have tried this game. The Ads are out of control, and sometimes I pay but it doesn't work, probably designed and fitted in with no ads would actually make this game a real fun game, pls do make some fast updates, I will be waiting.☺😊
317	3	a	" too bad for you.  And I can't switch between pages to find quickly what I want with horizontal sweep..."""
318	1	a	The devs clearly have no idea what they're doing. The list of compatible \ndevices is apparently very small. Didn't work on my s7. Doesn't work on my \ns9. Doesn't work on my tablet. I can legit emulate windows in a virtual \nmachine in my phone and run it there, but not via this app that I paid way \ntoo much for.
319	5	a	Good for balinese young generation to learn their language and culture. Great job..!!
320	2	a	Cueclub is much better in PC version. This game is not that much realistic, uninstalled
321	5	a	It is amazing  if you don't want to pay money just do a bracelet and you can make your own charm I do not know who these people are but there not kids this is coming from a kid and give you pretty charms for free and all the colors are free
322	4	a	Please add on toto grand 6/63 statistics
323	3	a	Warning use with causion. The app no matter what refuses to connect. At \nsome point my antivirus (bitdefender) started recognising the Pc server as \nmallware (probably a false positive but still be causious).
324	2	a	Keeps crashing and takes forever to reload.
325	5	a	This app is very perfect in executing it's desired function 👏
326	2	a	Continually crashing and the add on pack boasts that it has 800 questions yet each time I play the same questions come up
327	5	a	It's cool way to polish your French grammer
328	5	a	It can make reminders and checklist shopping list its cool
329	4	a	Very nice app for it's purpose. UI is outstanding. I don't always have the time to enter a reading at the time of measurement. It would be very nice to be able to enter a time as well as the date the measurement was taken,  in both the input and edit screens. Still a well done app.
330	5	a	I hope they will add more tools/items and more monsters. I love the pixel graphics of the game. :D This is the best game I played this year
331	1	a	Not good for my nikon d7100
332	5	a	I had this app before in my old country and i had fun recording gifs with my cousin..  Some of them were hilarious!  Thank you for this wonderful app that you gave us.  Thank you so much! :)
333	3	a	Whenever I'm in between a gap I get stuck and die. Make it so you can climb on the edges
334	5	a	Nc and trilling :) wow
335	3	a	Would be good to have a search function, too many mnemonics to scroll through
336	5	a	"I was a little worried at first because of other reviews. But I love it. I hand wrote over 300 movies down then I found this app. Will never write them again!  Only thing I would like to see is format option of \DVD/VUDU\"" I have many of them."""
337	1	a	Me and my little bro. Were sitting there on the couch and i installed it because it was Halloween and we played it and IT WAS BORING!!!!!
338	4	a	Nice one!  I just loved it!!  Impressive! Could be more interesting!!
339	1	a	This game sucks one level and then u hav to buy it uninstalling
340	1	a	all I can do is use the two keyboards none of the extra features work,
341	1	a	Very unresponsive and slow to complete the soul purpose of the app; surely turning on an led lamp shouldn't take 10 seconds and overwhelm what seems to be the entire processing power of the phone. What a pathetic app. And what the f#%k is the deal with a touch app requiring so many unnecessary permissions?!!
342	5	a	Great application. It just sits there quietly doing its thing. No notifications, no nags, no ads. If you want to go out for a night on the tiles don't forget to disable it, or your friends won't be able to contact you in the small hours. You can use the widget for this.
343	1	a	Thanks for the app FCC! Cant wait to see you crunch the data and spin our awful internet speeds in favor of big cable. We pay more money than any country for crappy service as is. Fixing that problem isn't an option...So...charging us more for 'fast lanes' is the answer!
344	5	a	No doubt it is marvellous and admiring.  The bridegroom will be overjoyed by Mahdi designing rather than bride
345	1	a	It was awful. Same reactions suckie game !!!!!!!!!!
346	1	a	Pali mi se reklama koju ne mogu maknuti jer nema x na njoj. Tako da vam app i ne mogu vise kotistit.
347	5	a	This app is so cute! I love it!
348	1	a	You can't play for the adds . You can't even pick one thing without it pausing and adds pop up Uninstalling
349	1	a	Need more guns and levels.!!!!!!!
350	5	a	I was trying to check whether the device supports OpenGL ES 2.0. Looks like its working fine
351	1	a	The reason why this is a free download and you have to pay to use it is because you won't have the option to refund it so the person who made it can keep the money. P.S you have to buy it again if you reinstalled it
352	3	a	Sends email fine (sender name would be nice) but can't decrypt its own messages?? (No header found)
353	1	a	"Many Spelling mistakes are made \tijori\"" is  written as tjiori"""
354	1	a	Very Bad game. Do not Download.🙄
355	5	a	All for you get a god time. . .
356	1	a	Might have given a better rating if I could actually play it I don't mind ads but this is crazy every 2 sec another ad
357	4	a	מעולה, הגיע הזמן לשנות את האייקון לעגול
358	4	a	Better than the first 9th Dawn in some ways, worse in others. Melee combat leaves much to be desired, especially regarding weapon selection and relative weapon range/size. The spear was slow, and felt like it had the range of a pencil. Jumping wasn't all that interesting to me, it's kinda arbitrary. Music and sound are wonderful. Atmosphere, graphics, and performance are great as well. One thing I miss from 1st game is the freedom of touch/looting everything from barrels to pots, why remove? Still buying.
359	3	a	When I click download it doesn't show in my nonifactions
360	4	a	Gr8 help when needed and only if you trust
361	3	a	Make this in english and I'll be your best friend.
362	5	a	Nice time filler, pleasant app
363	1	a	Complete waste of time. It is just a scam
364	5	a	Na de update doet de app het weer perfect!
365	5	a	Best app for Duas of Ahlebait. Contains English translation next to Arabic. Makes it easy to understand.
366	4	a	It asked what colour the g is in google I put blue as I knew the answer and you got it wrong and it said the answer was red sort it out!!! Then ill give you 5*
367	5	a	Because when i see running man is a good game
368	5	a	I love the scrolling effects.  I'vr tried just about every Launcher.  For these type of Launchers,  (Nova, Apex, Holo) I'd put Nova slightly ahead because its smoother. You can't go wron with ADW tho. Very nice.
369	1	a	Prefer old version. Dont need the phone token feature. At least maybank stll allow u to use the app without registering similar function as this phone token thing
370	4	a	My only real complaint about this game is the lack of redemption. I don't like that a mushroom means instant death. Other than that it's really fun, cute and silly. I've shared with some friends(that all thought I was making it up) and they all love it too!
371	5	a	This is a strangely wonderful game. The concept is odd and the game play is, at the same time, calming and exciting. The result is an emersive Zen like experience. If the concept seems off putting, don't be deterred.  This is a great game.
372	1	a	Guys just fix it please !!!
373	2	a	In older version it was giving all possible routes and I can choose by seeing the number of stops n no of switch I should take. Now it is asking via which route, so if I want to compare I should go back n select multiple times. Bus details was better in earlier version. In this it is mentioned that timing has included, but I m unable to find it.
374	5	a	I deleted 6 apps for this one app.
375	1	a	Will not work on SmartWatch two
376	5	a	All jokes aside, this is the BEST app I have ever hade the extreme pleasure of downloading. It has never crashed and barely uses any battery. The UI is easy to understand and the app opens almost instantly. Even Angry Birds doesn't hold a candle to this holy grail of Android software.
377	2	a	Boring not worth the price
378	5	a	Ini baru namanya aplikasi yg benar2 top.. gk seperti yang lain2 itu kaya tai anjing...
379	1	a	Doesn't work on my phone infinite
380	5	a	I love it so much because my kids love it
381	1	a	I dowloaded this app again thinking i would get a full version  and too many features are disabled to see if i like the app. FAIL.
382	4	a	@SANDY SCHULDT I know why it's not working.Its bc someone stupid has force stopped it
383	5	a	very useful and been very accurate- under the circumstances. what is really nice is that you can have more than one area selected for example home and work. just wish there was an alert/reminder feature
384	5	a	This my be costing money in the future so get it now because on app store in its this is 1.79
385	1	a	Are you  joking with us Hell
386	4	a	This app with totally up my alley but once I installed it I was confused by the interface. Only once I returned to the Google Play Store description did I see the instructions on how to use it. After that it was obvious that it works well. It could use a little UI polish, and I wish the app would post the My Tracks URL in the DailyMile comments, but otherwise it's a solid offering.
387	1	a	It keep saying app doesn't work when I push the on button.. Uninstall
388	5	a	I find it amusing that ppl spend fifty dollars and more to buy a console game but expect everything to be free for Android...LOL. Would I love this game FREE? Of Course! But NOTHING worthwhile is free in this world. Grat App! Hope to see more! I DO wish you had an all-inclusive pack that included the tools, but you probably knew you would sell less packages for an additional $5. You could have included them in the $10 pack. But, hey, nobody's perfect.
389	5	a	I'm using an lg mach. Absolutely love this app, so easy to use and fun. Its adictive though! Very accessible for the blind. Thanks for making this game!
390	1	a	This app used to work great on my Note 3, but won't let me rename (or name at all for that matter) the stinking files on my Note 10.1.  How am I supposed to organize notes? Create a new folder for every note just so I can name it? Additionally,  it no longer plays back sound.  This is now garbage.  Come on Dev!
391	3	a	Z is pronounced wrong. In game 2,  it says Y when itshould be T.
392	5	a	Is the best game on earth
393	1	a	How do you move were are the tiny fishes?!
394	5	a	works great. Thanks be to God. Motoroi eclair.
395	5	a	Love this game. The board pieces are too small for me, otherwise it would have been perfect! Where are the directions for the game? Is it possible to solve each of the games without ever using a shaffle? Also... There is a glitch on the android phone version. If you don't answer whether or not to challenge to the next game right away the option goes away and you have to close the game and restart it to play more. Thanks for listening. I play this game more than any of my others.
396	4	a	When it works this app is killer but the majority of times it gives the scrambled effect.  Update: the front camera works 100% of the time but the rear only works after you switch from rear camera to the front and back. Strange on a nexus device.
397	1	a	ItS a Boeing game stupide game it dos sent do toutirols
398	5	a	اللعبة بعد التحديث أصبحت بطيئة جدا ارجو حل المشكلة
399	1	a	found virus in the app .Scanned using AVG antivirus and TrustGo security.both displayed the same result. UNINSTALLING.
400	3	a	Good game,i won 5 gold medals in archery,1 gold and 1 silver in swimming,1 \nbronze in javeline.I loved the national anthem of india played when i won \nthe gold medal 6 times.It is like a proud moment that cuz of me national \nanthem is played,no matters at what level.But many of the games are locked \nin which also i can win gold medals
401	3	a	Can't get past level 231. Impossible to keep up with cars coming in.
402	5	a	I told my friends that Nash Grier called me,they all started crying and freaking out. They still think its real!
403	5	a	This game is very cool thanks for giving me
404	5	a	This is a great game but it just needs a update.
405	1	a	Stupid don't download this is the worst game ever
406	5	a	I would pay for this app. Special children should be thankful for the FREE \nAND AD FREE app.
407	5	a	Great app giving access to good music
408	5	a	It helps you work out more, it is like someone has joined you in working out. It is like going to the gym, others are working out, and you work out more. You can put your phone on the floor and see it playing while you are doing dumbbells exercise. Please note there is a small question mark icon (?) on the top of the screen that tells a bit about exercise timing.  Suggestion to the developer is if we can have mortal kombat background music?
409	5	a	Such a cute game! I love it!
410	1	a	$3/month....out of mind. Better use anydo much better
411	5	a	amazing app.. I love how a photo doesnt lose its quality after using this app. keep up the great work.
412	5	a	I'm usually a 'Word's game' person... But I've been thrilled about this game for a few years now.   I always have it on my devices...never gets boring to me. I REALLY, REALLY LOVE IT!!
413	1	a	Worst possible app in store. Should give negative Markings.
414	1	a	I don't know how it's possible for to take down prey. I mean I chased a bunny and attacking it but keep on missing! For more then two minutes! This game is a waste of time so don't install!!!!
415	2	a	Not supporting for xolo q800. Fix it
416	3	a	I like the girls in it because they look so beautiful and the background are also so lovely that I cant stop playing.\tThis game can be the best if all the make up, clothes etc. were unlocked for the players. I'd loved if the game had everything unlocked.
417	5	a	Please add to this program  a search facility like what they have in google map.  In this program you cannot search for destination address by writing the address.  Also it will be useful if you can mark 2 different destinations   on the Google map to send it to someone on a chat or mms program to help others with  directions Thank you for a great program . I noticed also that the program does not save location in the position part using samsung note 5 but it works good on samsung note 3
418	4	a	Y pues creo que esta bueno
419	5	a	Great for kids and adults alike
420	5	a	Sharp \u0026 crisp images.☆ Like the idea. ☆Was hoping the owl would move. ~It will look nice for the season.☆
421	5	a	Omg when I saw dr.slenderman he scared the living hevons out of me he almost gave me a hard attack
422	5	a	Simply awewome, flawless... loved it... nothing could be better infact... great work...
423	4	a	It good I luv it but sometimes  some word I can't  search but this app still can use!
424	1	a	This app should be removed from the Google store.  It won't restore backed up text messages.
425	5	a	I work with children who are nonverbal and who use sign. This will be a great app for them to learn some simple words through spelling and signing!  Love it!!
426	1	a	It was working great. I'm not sure if this was recently updated. Game play is suspended while add is active. There is no way to turn off the fashing add, trying to do so opens playstore. Game play resumes once the add is finishes allowing a few more moves before the add begins again. I really enjoyed this game. Now I am deleting it!
427	5	a	It so cute I have always love children that are younger than me. I'm 9. Lol. Anyways it is so sweet in Cute I LOVE BABY HAZEL AND HER GAMES!!💖❤💚💜💙💛
428	2	a	So plz dont download this friends
429	5	a	Best live wallpaper app on G store.Bright nature waterfalls themes would do great.
430	2	a	Should of had on screen movement or an option to enable it.
431	2	a	The challenges give you mini goals to do and it's a blast when it works but now every other game I'll get to around 37 and the game freezes and crashes. Hasn't been an issue before so this is now the reason I'm uninstalling.
432	5	a	Fantastic service and love the print finish great prices will definitely be using them again
433	5	a	Love it but controls are pretty hard to control
434	5	a	I love Wolfe's they are my favorite animal in the 🌎
435	5	a	The app is awesome,  if u can add the feature of zooming and rotation of the image , it will be perfect , i wish to consider my request
436	5	a	WHAT?!!!! A GAME BEST THING I HAVE EVER PLAYED SINCE JESUS LOST HIS SANDLES I PLAY THIS 24/7
437	3	a	Not bad. Pictures take way too slow
438	1	a	I don't like this app. Doesn't let you change the colors and took forever to install.
439	5	a	App bagus, semoga bisa di tingkatkan
440	4	a	I would give 5 stars if it would NOT stop running after so long. Please fix
441	5	a	مشكورين على البرنامج برنامج ممتاز لكن لو تم اضافة جميع الأدعية للبرنامج كان أفضل وكل هذا انشاءالله في ميزان حسناتكم
442	5	a	Cool aplikacija, laka za upotrebu, lepo dizajnirana.
443	4	a	Now seriously, great game, but, damn, is that ad annoying. The one to Air Control that covers up about a tenth of the screen. I get it, but leave it for a couple of seconds. Please. If it weren't for this ad, it would deserve 5 stars.
444	5	a	SUPERB help for learning vessel lights! strongly suggested!!!!
445	1	a	Thank you htc for forcing us all to accept an app nobody wanted or needed,  and for disallowing anyone from getting rid of.
446	1	a	Try to open I scroll through the people when I get to the end (wonda sykes) it closes. Happens every time. Haven't been able to try it out
447	5	a	നന്ദി ഒണ്ട് ബുള്ളറ്റ് ട്രെയിൻ സിമുലേറ്റർ ഇതാണ് ബെസ്റ്റ്
448	3	a	Maybe have dens and different dog breeds and more quests. Good otherwise.
449	5	a	It amazes me on how dead on it can be in most cases.  Enjoy!
450	5	a	This game rocks!!!! Its turn based with strategy. Very awesome.  Wish I could play in a tournament.....  and with other people
451	5	a	I just love the game, it's one of my old card games I use to play when I was a kid. Thanks so very much for having it for free.
452	5	a	Awesome app! I was just amazed to see that it works flawlessly after I patched and compiled the kernel, and set selinux enforcement to 0.
453	4	a	I really like it, but it would be better if there was Chinese language and you could choose the color of the keyboard (not use a picture). Then it would definitely be 5 stars.
454	1	a	Uncontrollable and it's a brand new Samsung Galaxy S6 Active
455	3	a	was looking forward to having the faces integrated with the text...  its dope... one step at a time!
456	1	a	"I usualy love Halloween game but whoever made this game...\ It is the stupidest game ever!!!!! \"""""
457	5	a	Please Add Currency info on the world.If we guessing the name of flag is right, its have some info.add Currency info on there ok so I can learn that to thanks.
458	4	a	Can you add an overnight allowance entry otherwise this is a good basic timesheet
459	5	a	"For a free app without ads, this is perfect.  I only wonder what is that sixt play mode with a locked icon...  Otherwise I think the only confusing button is when trying to resume a play.  Putting the description of the command below the button to distinguish  between \resume\"" and \""restart\"" would be helpful."""
460	5	a	Top top. Muito cool esta aplicação, recomendo.
461	5	a	Amaca uygun sade ve kullanışlı
462	3	a	Am trying to open is not responding the way I want.
463	5	a	Creative genius. Both sent to giggle at prepubescent dirty jokes and solve adult psychosis in co dependant cycling of adulthood. Well played good sir, well played. I expect this to do well with any mind who dares the rabbit hole.
464	2	a	Its sort of funny because it keeps automatically farting jingle bells
465	5	a	It is very good application for Delhi visit
466	5	a	I tried a lot. Fat fingers. This one is a classical beauty. OK, no smileys, word predictions, dictionaries, but I work in 2 languages, and that was a fuss. BIG KEYS ! YOU CAN PROGRAM THE SIZE ! I like this one. Keeping it, please try and agree.
467	4	a	Generally a fun game. I like the cartoon-like graphics. Quick. Responsive. Small install.  Oddly sometimes I only get one star, despite having deceived a couple of hits, so have to repay a number of levels to get to unlock more levels.  Also, I wouldn't mind advertisements, but due the fact that the screen goes black after they've played, I need to restart the game. This happens after every 2 levels
468	5	a	Let's you pass when you can go so you can win
469	1	a	can't load it as everyone else can't either.
470	1	a	Pictures are gorgeous,BUT,,,,,THE ADS ARE DISGUSTING ,,,can't get to \nsettings to get what you need to set up animated home page,I had 1 day and \nthe the next morning it was gone, can't restore it to way it was. ,makes me \nso sad
471	1	a	После запуска чёрный экран и никаких новостей
472	2	a	Why have to play againest someone to play this game. Prefer if I could just play this game on my own. And why the question category sessions so short.
473	3	a	Would be 5 stars if we could earn zooms instead of buying them
474	4	a	I wpuld love to give his a five star but I am a really good team player and love to play with ohers instead of solo but for some reason when i go to co op or arena it always says no players online even if this game says it has 50k downloads and im pretty sure im not the only one so please fix muliplayer please and thank you 😇😇😇
475	5	a	I would love a full theme to go with this...Go Locker and Go Launcher. PLEASE!!! :)
476	5	a	Makes one THINK....plus Free Cell , Spider and Solitaire regular or Vegas.
477	1	a	My son didnt have fun~ so boring

481	2	a	Does not work on droid x
482	3	a	I bought this now it won't work since I factory reset my phone
483	3	a	Didn't you know why you don't have many people who download these apps? Because not everythings is free. Only Only the steps. The accessories okay, but only the steps please. Do it and I will put 5 stars
484	5	a	Very good, may i did not understand
485	1	a	Cant see anything bar 1st page screenshot above ...need a real app where users can add hotspots one person can activate hotspot
486	5	a	Tried it and it left my teeth glistening. I use it every morning and evening now. Try it it really does work.  Recommended by meeeeeeeeeee
487	2	a	I have not had one instance when the album art finder actually worked .  if it were fixed it would be much better
488	5	a	Really beautiful and personalized. Works very smoothly!
489	3	a	Doesn't work anymore, since upgrade to Lollipop 5.1.1. Also, there were problems with WhatsApp group chats, especially the muted ones. Whenever I received non-muted ones from individual chats, it would send me all messages, including the muted ones from groups, thus erasing the individuals. Any fix would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!
490	5	a	Helps to survive from all struggles. My own experience.
491	5	a	جالبه فقط باطری مصرف میکنه برای کسانی که طولانی مدت به گوشی احتیاج دارن بازم خوبه مصرفش اونقدا زیاد نیست
492	5	a	I love this game but i hate ads
493	2	a	Needs some bugs fixed! I love this game on pc, so I figure I'd try it before I bought it. The sound is screwed up.. I tried restarting my phone and uninstall/reinstall and still doesn't work properly. Please fix!!
494	4	a	Get people of different accents, and you get 5
495	5	a	This arcade game a hidden gem in the play store.  It's gameplay is fun and addictive and if you ever get bored for some reason, you could just look at the character roster and see all the tiny details like gender and stuff.  This game is great but the underwater part is too easy for my liking.
496	1	a	It is saying username and password is in correct
497	4	a	Good control, need graphic tune, nice overall.
498	5	a	Stvarno izvrsna aplikacija. Svaka čast. Samo da se nastavi održavati kako spada i to je to :)
499	4	a	This game gets my goat! It's a lot of fun and drives me a little crazy, which is a good thing because it means my brain is working. I think. ;)
500	5	a	Quit showin the stupied adds i don,t want them
501	3	a	Its OK I don't like how you can't finish your mission if you get this you have to be fast and careful or you just lose  the first one was better
502	5	a	The Great App Of The Great Player And Most Beautiful Lady...!!!
503	5	a	come on guys come up with an update cauz m loving this app...
504	2	a	Precisa urgentemente de ranking entre amigos do face.
505	4	a	Clock bug where my clocks hour will turn to 00 whenever its noon or midnight for the whole hour of 12. Uninstalling and reinstalling the app doesn't fix it and neither does messing with my clock settings. I have a Motorola droid ultra. Other than that, I love the app. It was very easy to figure out and use to make some great themes. Love all the customization options!
506	2	a	I really wanted this app but when I downloaded it to my phone I would have \nto go in every time and reset the flash because it would never work.
507	5	a	फाइन ___यह कोई कमनहीं ।
508	5	a	Cool to find the Bible Verse you want.
509	4	a	Ad gets in the way on standings page and there is nothing you can do about it.
510	1	a	Its useless. How does this have any thing to do with VR?
511	3	a	Please add an option to remove the three dot menu on the bottom of the screen
512	5	a	And not too many distracting ads
513	1	a	Kuchh samajh me hi nahi aata hai..boaring
514	2	a	Can we change the Android emojies with the reboot app ?
515	5	a	They can know the feeling of app
516	4	a	5 будет с появлением настроек предпочтений, желательно с рейтингом, и автоскролла с настройкой скорости. А так пока все нравится.
517	2	a	só serve pra ver a programação, e olhe lá. é pesado, lento, e inconsistente.
518	1	a	There is no display and when you toggle freeze frame you get a bury frame but as soon ax you touch the screen it goes black again. Flash sort of works
519	2	a	Supposed to b able to change mood background color. Well it doesn't change it goes back to the red color. I paid a 1.00 for this and it's exactly the same as the original
520	1	a	Said mobile site is down so can't connect.... blah blah blah.  F**king take it out of the Play Store!!!
521	4	a	Przydałoby się wsparcie dla ekranów 18:9
522	5	a	The app is really excellent. But there are some minor faults. In Assamese- Inscript keyboard, some Kannada alphabets are present. Also the bengali keyboard should contain zero width joiner and non joiner. In Bengali- Avro keyboard, when I try to write অর্ক with the alphabets 'orko', it becomes অরক. Please give a reply for this problem.
523	1	a	Can't enter your owner monthly budget amount, what's the point?
524	5	a	It's an exciting game this game was so good
525	3	a	خوب بود.اگر پیشرفته تر باشه بهتره.
526	4	a	Awesome app really good for practise when your just sitting around bored , needs to make the buttons bigger for smaller phones though
527	5	a	This is an awesome idea but its up to us to keep posting pics and make it even better
528	5	a	Finished all 27 levels (?) i want more!
529	5	a	For real black hats ;)
530	4	a	This game is interesting But there are too hard to get a resources and we must top up to get the bot. Adding mod to turrent,gun and etc too expensive Anyway this game is perfect
531	1	a	I used to have adh on my s4 ,I had a software update and then It was not reinstated, but when I try to reload it it doesn't want to login
532	5	a	Beautiful art love the app
533	5	a	Because it was so good, I had to buy it.
534	1	a	This app sucks royally. Google star chart is so much better.
535	1	a	This app is useless. When I try to connect to the share, I'm asked for a password. Nothing tells me what the password is, or how to set the password. Don't waste your time.
536	1	a	Splash screen appears in French. And that's it. No option to proceed. There's something about Facebook but I don't use Facebook. I thought Accorplus was an Accor loyalty program. But this is a Facebook loyalty app not Accor.
537	4	a	Question are you guy's or guy solo developing or are you guys even working on it at all
538	4	a	The interface lags like hell, I have played HD 3D games on my device, worked so smooth, but your app lags in navigation. Totally apparent in scrolling.   Otherwise good.
539	5	a	Clear, helpful and instructive app. Even got rapid reply from developer on cloud sync.
540	4	a	Werry good for those who teaveled :)
541	1	a	Installed the latest version on my brand new Samsung S6. Pairs with my new 5100 no problem but that is as far as it will go. Numerous attempts to get technical support for this problem have failed and basically I was told that it does not appear to be compatible with  the S6 'at this time'.
542	5	a	Lovely but has some problem
543	4	a	App is great. I used it very often and i found most books i was looking for. But the UI need some enhancements and sometimes books are not visible and you need to restart the app to fix it...
544	5	a	Let me get this out the way- If you are just here for the sound effects, then this probably isn't for you. This game feels alot more like it's for people who know their guns.  It's really goddamn satisfying to collect and fire these guns, especially if you have a goal of a certain gun in mind and you've been saving up. I still can't believe there are 416 guns in this (at time of writing), even though it's just an app.  The actual fun though, only lasts so long. If you just want to collect guns, then it'll go on for a while but if you want to really customise something you've hit a bit of a dead end, You can only do paint jobs -and even then they are all the same, very few have unique skins. But skins like the older gun's 'Battleworn' and the wooden Furniture options are really nice.  All in all this game is a gun nut's dream. But In future it would be nice to see weapon customisation like scopes, rails, or accessories. It would also be nice to some guns getting slightly better sounds. Most of them are good but it's the odd one out that has a problem, namely the Scar-H.
545	1	a	This game sucks dont download this
546	5	a	Full of great info...if you are trying to live a healthy lifestyle, download now.
547	3	a	It's a cute game but an ad after every level you pass is very annoying.
548	5	a	It is bad because it won't work.
549	5	a	Putem sa ne votam favoriții în liniște!
550	1	a	Too many ads.  No way to preview the background before you exit the application so you have to sit through like 3 ads for every background you want to see.  I deleted the app immediately.
551	5	a	I like cats more than dogs because I have a bad experience with dogs. I find them annoying.  I cats and kittens are my favorite animals. My cats are so cute and funny. I have 3 cats. I love this app.
552	5	a	IT IS A GOOD FOR OUR INCOME AND MONTHLY EXPENSES
553	5	a	I'm in San Francisco and reading these news regularly at list twice a day. Have this app. on the both systems : Android and iOS. it works very well.
554	4	a	it's a game for pros. Love it but it's too short.
555	5	a	Works great. Very helpful for beginners like me. Easy and simple tutorials thank you for created app like this. Love it
556	1	a	Doesn't work it always crashes
557	4	a	Need too much phone's permissions
558	5	a	Thanks Murat Very helpfull Learn \u0026 Test
559	1	a	It didn't work on my Samsung 9+
560	5	a	Loved it but can you add in some Micro-Nations flags? Such as Sealand, Ladonia, and Seborga? And the ancient country's that have died out like Prussia and Holy Roman Empire or Rome (because it used to be a Nation). As for the Maps Greenland needs to be added since it has been a country for more than 4,000 years. Back to the flags add Greenlands as well.
561	5	a	Amazing!! Best app that I found and it even worked great!!
562	2	a	It wont load it just stays at the picture screen
563	1	a	"Cannot even open the app to assess if it works. Immediately get \app keeps \nstopping\"" message. Waste of time."""
564	1	a	Tried this out using my house. Went out for a walk and tried to let it take me home. Took me past my house and told me to keep walking.
565	1	a	"installed fine on Android 5.1, but any pin i try on setup fails with \unknown error occurred while processing\"".  how can this be secure or reliable?"""
566	1	a	HTC one M7 software loads but nothing is working waste of data download.
567	5	a	CHAI TOBIAS: I gave an excellent rate for this game. though it's limited coz it's free. but I love to play this app. everyday.
568	5	a	I love this app. Works fast and you can see ths improvement
569	5	a	Awesome App!  Love easy access to great life inspiration ♡♡
570	2	a	App freezes on phone too often.
571	5	a	I change my look and enjoy the new one.
572	5	a	This is the best game I have ever played in my life that is why I am rating it a 5 out of 5
573	1	a	l'application demande un peu trop de permission pour juste passer de la musique et afficher des news… décu de radio nova.
574	1	a	D tunggu versy baru x
575	5	a	greatly dislike being bugged to rate an app. My original phone died and this is one of the few apps I put on the temp. I don't recall the ads being as obnoxious in my first install.
576	2	a	Please fix it quickly. I need some information about Paris to complete my writing. Thanks. I'll give it 5 stars later.
577	5	a	What a perfect way to gently fly all your troubles away... THANK YOU FOR LETTING US ALL FLY AWAY...!
578	3	a	She speaks way too fast for a beginner like me.
579	5	a	Where were you back when I was a tool \u0026 die apprentice.  A must have for machinest.
580	5	a	This is so cute and the best app ever
581	5	a	Every time I listen to this asp I always wake up feeling amazing. Wish i could afford the rest  the apps to see where else this deep sleep all could take me in my life. It's already had such a positive effect on my life and I'm a stifle mother of four.  Thank you for this wonderful app. Looking forward for more.
582	4	a	The RESUME and NEW GAME should have some type of safeguard.  I like to just keep playing but when you accidentally hit 'new game' all your scores and games are erased.
583	5	a	Works great! My dog loves it too! If you charge it in the mircrowave for 30 seconds on high you can get a purple laser!!!
584	5	a	This game is very awesome! I like the pixelation you guys did. But can you please add more gamemodes?! THAT WOULD BE AWESOME 😁😁!!
585	2	a	Not enough credits To start out with credits go fast
586	5	a	Veeery very addictive game ever. I realy love it,play it  everyday. Good work my 5 stars  for you guys.
587	1	a	I can't stand the items that help you jumping every few seconds. It's distracting and annoying.
588	1	a	I had some ringtonebacks good for 6 months and all of sudden everything disappeared. Im disappointed because I bough 5 ringback tones that supposed to be good for 6 months and there is nothing anymore waist of money!!!
589	5	a	مريحه وتساعد على الهدوء النفسى بارك الله فيكم

591	5	a	My 4yr old grandson is gonna Love, Love, Love this game!!! I Love this game especially Zen Warrior! Someone Said... I'm not so good at, LOL. He Loves fireworks to start with \u0026 he really loves the games on his tablet or on Memaw's phone. Can't wait to show him this Awesome game. I Highly recommend it to Anyone, young \u0026 old!!!!
592	2	a	This game clearly has a rig to it.  Online play requires you enlist your contacts.  Too many ads... sigh!  Build up your chips slightly and then it runs a large losing streak.  Minimally entertaining.  I gave 2 stars because the music is catchy.
593	5	a	Vraiment super, très précise et très esthétique. Toutes les fonctionnalités que je voulais y sont, une application vraiment très réussite !
594	5	a	عالی بود  دیگه حرفی ندارم
595	5	a	This is a great game for the destruction of the one car but it would be alot more fun  if you added new cars. Overall this is a superb game
596	5	a	Love it so amazing I am in love with this app
597	1	a	It's so odd that this pathetic version hasn't been touched in over 7 months, yet seems to be getting worse. If the content wasn't so entertaining, I'd give up on it.
598	5	a	Flowers are always beautiful and brighten your day. Loved it.
599	3	a	"I love the visual quality of these wallpapers and would give it 5 * except after paying for the ability to pin, some wallpapers will not pin. Also, for some reason it is no longer possible to choose categories. The app now seems to be set to \earthporn\"". I now miss out on the many varieties of wallpaper that was once available. I would appreciate hearing from the developer regarding this issue."""
600	4	a	The description of this app is misleading. It gives the impression that typical lists already exist in the app when in actuality, there are no lists. Items for the one list are created by the user. There are a few modifications that can be made to the layout, ie font size or how checked items are handled. I really like the way you can rearrange or remove items on your list. Like others, at first I thought having tabs for multiple lists would be helpful but that would take away from the simplicity of the app
601	4	a	You get very few options and it asks you to rate half way into the first game which would make you wonder a little and it is very timid in the first half so you dont really get to see how sexual it can be.
602	5	a	Masha-Allah very user friendly interface..looks good in PDF reader and even better in WPS office.. its clarity doesn't change no matter how much u zoom it.. Jazak-Allah khairan may Allah bless u.  Allah-Hafiz
603	4	a	Fun to play. Sometimes hints do not work.
604	5	a	I love your games... but their all so expensive if you could make them free or even 1 dollar that would be great 💟
605	1	a	There are so many bugs in this app, most of the functions don't work. It \nneeds a serious improvement. For a company as big as Hoyts, I expect much \nbetter
606	5	a	Simple deductive reasoning, though the agats change with higj difficulty
607	3	a	Weird white light comes from the bottom not in the free version or the \nGoogle Play screenshots.
608	5	a	Please add a hi-res image of the keyboard for tablets, besides that this rocks, thanks!
609	1	a	How to take application passwt
610	5	a	Easy to use. It would be good to take a friend with you so one of you can be in the photo. I will enjoy discovering each new image on Monday and Friday. Very nice mailer to announce services plus app as a segway to services. Well done!!
611	1	a	ממשק מאוד כבד ומעצבן, ברגע שאתה יוצא לרגע מהאפליקציה ומשאיר אותה מאחורי \nהקלעים היא פשוט מאתחלת את החיפוש! אחת האפליקציות המעצבנות שנתקלתי בהן.
612	2	a	Good idea. Not executed well. Some of the encounters are dumb or nonsensical. Others incomplete, overly detailed or not detailed enough. Mildly useful, but not enough to recommend greatly.
613	1	a	But it is not working in my phone
614	1	a	Really bad quality game..takes long to load and I would never recommend it to anybody.
615	2	a	Worked before.  Now blacks out when you try to turn the page.
616	5	a	Das Beste was ich bisher gesehen habe. Funktioniert sehr gut!!! Vielleicht gäbe es noch eine inApp purchase version mit Addfree
617	5	a	Funny; funnier for family prank!
618	3	a	How do I set it as my keyboard????
619	5	a	"This game is awesome! I've been playing it for a couple months, several times a day. It keeps you on your toes in such a challenging way. Love it Love it Love it!  Would like to see one thing/game play added though...how about a \magic\"" play that would wipe out one place or entire row/column?"""
620	5	a	It is very nice... It is little boring I want you all to just bring a littlI jie change in it.. Welllll the truth is the best game is doctor kids 03... Just add some more activities in it... I deleted it because it was little boring ... Games in which many activities are present are nice.. But think of we just play only one thing , so we will get bore.. I agree comments of some people... But , don't be mad on one game its called madness.. I hate those people who just become mad on one game... Who do this , they need mental treatment... Like, some people change their names.. They need mental treatment specialy.... Do you know, my friend Prachi changed her name into max by playing this game she was just mad on it.. Now I don't talk to her... So friends do not be mad on any game... Like someone who shared his brief brother he was literally mad on this game..                         Read it for a lesson... pls pls..
621	1	a	FASTFOLD NOT WORKING again. This time it has been over a week ! Designers need to update that portion. OR maybe update the designers... Im giving it 3 more days until I go to Live Hold'em or Lucky Poker.
622	1	a	It doesn't work..  Just like trying html  basic class..  And the button too it only appears in the app and not in the home screen.. It disappears when i exit the app.. Only the fools will go first to this app to oppen another app.. I am uninstalling it..
623	2	a	I paid for pro version but never  got it. Pls tell me why or how to upgrade this. Change to 5 stars if i get my pro version that i paid for
624	5	a	I like the color scheme and the layout of the app. It really sparked my interests.
625	5	a	I would recommend this game from young to old its amazing
626	1	a	Doesn't work on my nexus 7 2nd generation . how disappointing. Please fix this asap . I swear to give you 5 stars for that 😰
627	4	a	Needs more levels, but I love the game
628	5	a	Useful app and no ads. Maps are current. This app do what it says. Love it. \nThanks
629	5	a	So simple, and yet so entertaining! I use real life riding techniques to beat each course. The bike just doesn't have enough power. Other than that I love it!
630	5	a	Awesome game. Very addictive and challenging too. Nice blend of quick thinking and strategy!
631	5	a	Use it a lot and it help me to sloove problems.
632	4	a	the blemish editor is great
633	3	a	love it. just wish you could chage the background
634	5	a	Awesome, addicting, and just plain fun. Wether you are killing zombies on Bokor or killing Pus captains with friends this game has endless hours of gameplay. It is one of the best games I have come upon and I would recommend Gun Bros. anyone.
635	5	a	Don't even need real money to play thank u developed best game ever for passing time......loved the music of paris also...merci
636	4	a	If  the  amount  chosen  is high  and  the  repayment  period  is high  ,the  figures  shown  under  intrest  and  total  has  oversize   error  which  has  to be  corrrcted.  .  Otherwise  it  is  good
637	2	a	"  if possible. Please fix this..."""
638	5	a	FIND THE WORDS, EASY TO DIFFICULT KEEPS YOUR BRAINS WORKING.
639	5	a	Preksha meditation transforms the way we live, making it more enjoyable and filled with positivity. In our busy schedule, an app like this will not just motivate us to practice meditation but also help to spread the word among the community at large.
640	2	a	Won't work  at all anymore.  It worked for an hour and I loved it, now it just sucks.
641	5	a	the perfect time waster / procrastinator. the track changes every time so even if you lose repeatedly it's always new. easy to rack up points to get new circles, challenges are fun and not impossible. liked it so much i dl'd it on my phone and tablet.
642	1	a	One of the worst apps ever.
643	5	a	Awesome game I play this game 2 times it doesn't make me boring
644	5	a	Oooops I meant to give graphics a 2 I just think they could be better but everything  else about the game is cool.
645	1	a	Same problem as other users. $50 credit wiped to $0.
646	3	a	Good at first but then you realise if you get to a high enough speed it will go eternally as if you crash into a wall you just go through it and the game won't recognise it as a crash. Basically, fun game but needs more
647	4	a	I wish more games worked but playing Zelda and n64 mario games on my phone is awesome. I really wish Conker's Bad Fur Day worked. It took some getting use to the c buttons being the right analog stick but I actually like it better than the old c buttons.
648	5	a	I WILL NOT take this out my phobe. It blesses me to know and challenges me to recall. Im 66
649	1	a	This is the worst app ever!!!!!
650	1	a	This game is so bad to play with it.
651	5	a	I love it in the moment I play it
652	2	a	Not good scary at all.. pass...
653	4	a	Im enjoying this app and i really donr notice any latency which seams common eith anroid gear apps. I had some fun loading up some mynown 2 bar loops and triggrring with the pads. And jamming alingn to tracks playing via my music player app is a super fun way to pass the time. Not sure hiw but a record button transport just showed up in one session, but when it showed up the volume slider was gone. Also it would be nice ro audition cudtom changes to the samples on the fly (volume, tunning etc). Thanks for this app
654	5	a	Kids r enjoy this app
655	3	a	Nice, i'll give 5 stars if you can please add second, day, date, and month :)
656	1	a	what kind of emergency loan app is this? totally useless. I tried it two years ago, got disappointed this is the second time...same old none sense. calculating for a week???? has been calculating for two years. totally useless app. no stars deserved not even one.
657	1	a	you guys need town put car town  on here again instead of this stupid version of it
658	4	a	The app is really great and the best sidebar app I have ever used. But whenever I add a widget they don't seem to update after a while. I have a clock and weather widget added to the home panel but the clock doesn't change the time neither does the weather update... ill give 5 stars if this issue is sorted out. Thanks for this great app.
659	2	a	It's not a free app.  why don't you tell users  upfront about it  .doggie business practice
660	1	a	BLOATWARE it's bad enough that my phone has only 8gb of internal memory then VM has to cram useless crap like this on to their phones. Thankfully it has an uninstall feature. VM LESS BLOATWARE PLEASE
661	1	a	مو جادر العب عشان الماب لود جاعد يجاتعني فلو عاوزين ما امسح العبة و بلغ جوجل شيلو
662	1	a	Can't log in using my credentials which works perfectly with explorer version. Unistalling it
663	5	a	I know  how to fly higher just get on a mountain and fly off it
664	1	a	This app is essentially useless. It doesn't have any live information like that is available on the website, slow to load, and stops displaying data randomly. dont even bother. SMA need to stick to making inverters, as ther software development skills are somewhat lacking
665	5	a	Love it so far \u0026 happy that I found the ringer I was looking for.. the only \nthing I have found that I don't like is.. if you hit a ringtone twice by \nmistake it adds that ringtone 2x in list.. why add it the second time when \nits already showing?? Now I have 2 of the same ringtone name showing in my \nringtone list.. ugh!!!
666	5	a	Kindly add Telugu language also...it will help a lot for our people.
667	5	a	i would like a paid version with no adds
668	4	a	Fantastic as far as it goes. Top down view, Isometric view, in fact this handles any angles or elevation for the map (and minis) that you could wish for. I've not seen a more professional looking rpg app on android and have been having fun trying out the various features.   Unfortunately, even though it works perfectly on my 2 year old moto g, it immediately force closes on my much newer kindle fire HD tablet, so is not as usable as I would have hoped. The small screen on my phone makes it a little bit of a chore so I was relying on the kindle really for real usability.  Still, wonderful example of what can be achieved on portable devices these days.
669	5	a	I considered a lower star rating because how can I say I love a flashlight app. But use it often and you'll understand.
670	2	a	App doesn't seem to fully download. It says it's installed but it never stops 'working'. Nothing else works.
671	4	a	the addition of a text addition feature?  I'd love to be able to add captions to my creations :) Also, when I first began using this app, focus was instant.  For some reason this changed and now, about one second into my recording, there is a shift in focus, resulting in a slightly blurred still image.
672	3	a	Just when I think it's working and I can purchase the key, it fails worse than ever.  Features are OK, mostly works, but it won't let you fix things when the app forgets an entry or two (it usually still remembers the odometer from the missing entries and thinks you are entering a wrong value).   Really painful, still looking for an app that works.
673	3	a	I uninstalled all these apps because they update too darn frequently
674	1	a	I can not be registered.
675	1	a	Stopping automatically... Couldn't record even a single call
676	1	a	Unable to load the app after installing
677	5	a	dobra aplikacija, rabote bez greshka. samo nogu dvosmisleni prashanja, ali za toa si e sekako MVR kriva. sho povekje narod ne poloze -poveke pari xa niv :)

680	2	a	The stories don't really  scare you nor do you feel the chills.
681	1	a	Does not work on Nexus 7 (1st Gen)
682	5	a	Greatesr app for practicians and students
683	5	a	great app that is crucial for gameplay but wish there was an option to select the ingredients being mixed versus relying only on camera since it didn't always work or was hard to get the app to recognize the cards  EDIT: Didn't think to check the settings! I didn't realize I didn't have to use the camera to select the ingredients.  Changing my rating from 4 stars to 5.
684	3	a	Its a nice little game and people should sponsor it so the devs can make it wide stream and improve the game. Thumbs to u developers u deserve a sponsor
685	5	a	I can play this game all day
686	1	a	Minus za brak możliwości wyeksportowania nr konta.
687	3	a	I don't really like it because it boring but it better for other people but try it out!
688	2	a	This app only has 3 songs. Not hapy.
689	3	a	The game in starting is good but its stuck later I mean tried to solve all the mystery or to find that peroxide but I didn't get anything so is this like that to buy the next episode or to try searching i feel like to play more
690	5	a	Facil, bonita y no pesa mucho. Se pueden compartir las repetidas y las q faltan :)
691	5	a	Have search my Android Device inside and out for something that was never there. Thank you Erik for being there when Google fails...
692	5	a	This is the only application which actually lived up to the expectations! !!
693	5	a	I scream u scream we all scream for more updates!!!!!
694	1	a	This sucks none of the eye colors are free like the actual app. All this does is make you jump through all the hoops but then when you can actually pick an eye color it brings to a whole other app that guess what! ITS NOT FREE!!!😡
695	2	a	I stopped pressing and i did not get the answer to where the black button \nis! :(
696	5	a	Only played this game for a short time: already a favorite.   I like not getting cut off by limited time as other games do...UPDATE...awesome game.  Most perfectly put together.  Great; THANK YOU
697	1	a	I checked my internet connection. Other apps are working with internet
698	5	a	Excellent game, great graphics and you can never lose! Lots and lots of fun! A must download!!!😘😘🍻
699	5	a	It is very goood app
700	5	a	the best application of Friendship
701	1	a	Used to love this game but now it won't load, just a black screen and utterly useless. Running on a galaxy s8. If you can fix the game I'd rate at 5 stars but until you do it's pointless, would rate at zero stars if I could
702	2	a	Starting at the beginning: °There are multiple spelling mistakes in the Privacy Policy Agreement (which is also spelled wrong) °I can unlock my phone by pressing the home button, defying the purpose of the app °And setting up a wallpaper is such a pain, because the cropping controls are bad and the final picture quality has such low resolution, i mean i know i can do all that in my gallery but isn't that what this app is for.

705	1	a	Not accurate at all, first result says read speed 22 MB/s but second result \nsays 209MB/s and 0 MB/s for write speed
706	5	a	" THERE ARE 100S OF THESE FOR FREE."""
707	5	a	I absolutely love it and have spent hours playing on my down time, and the ability to pick back up exactly where I left off hours later and being able to play with any amount of time available, there is still a downfall. Yepp, you guessed it. Mentioned before in several comments a menu interface would be nice, for restarting levels. I also would like to see some sort of interface for replaying holes you have already beaten, but this is not necessary as I enjoy this game's random and creative levels. 4.8/5
708	4	a	Needs more polish but it does what its supposed to do so can't complain. smaller font and cards would be appreciated for larger screens.
709	5	a	This game i so much fun
710	1	a	It can't play sharps or flats, the sound has no adjustable attack or decay time - in fact it has no decay time or sustain at all.
711	5	a	فارسی مگه چشه چرااا ترجمه فارسی نمیزارن اخه
712	5	a	Great game, but it has a problem with signing me in to Google Play. I have a conection but it doesn't seem to detect it so I can't sign sign in or play multiplayer. Please fix!
713	1	a	App wont stay open  keeps closing at the dead mushroom loading screen not worth the time to download
714	1	a	Crashes all the time. If you cant manage android, stick to improving your desktop.
715	5	a	Thi is good for kids
716	1	a	👎 Too many annoying adds, uninstalled within 5 minutes ,
717	3	a	Scores appearing again, but still no notifications, broken widget, no scorecard until a wicket falls. But could be worse.
718	1	a	No information for the technically illiterate
719	1	a	Why doesn't this one have the witch and magian
720	4	a	This app is great. I found out that my bmi is 15.8 which puts me at the very bottom of ofthe underweight section. Now I know how bad I am, I can get help to increase my weight. Thanks for the app dev.
721	5	a	Ok, this app is amazing! It is well developed and polished and contains great pedi information.
722	5	a	I havent even played this yet and dont need to. Im giving this 5 stars for the idea. Someone said 'You know whats a good game that should be an app? Darkstone.' I already started this game on an emulator I bought. Ill try this one later.
723	3	a	Didn't have a consistent way to stay on,  of enough tinting options.
724	4	a	It is very good game for android
725	1	a	This does not work it keeps saying its not filled in properly or password does not match with username
726	5	a	Passed first time. All the questions i passed in the mock on this app were in my actual test so very happy. 5 stars!!!
727	5	a	I'm fed up of my HTC One go vibrating randomly EVEN when the phone is set to silent and all apps have vibration mode turned off. It's ridiculous. Finally I can pick up my phone in the morning, turn on notifications without the STUPIDLY loud vibration waking my partner up.
728	5	a	I love this  so cute and nice
729	2	a	Good concept but needs serious work. There are no flats and only 2 octaves. I can do double that on my actual bassoon. Also why would you start on a c? You should start it on a B flat which is the lowest note on the bassoon. Fix these problems and I will rate 5 stars.
730	1	a	Google waleyo ehh adds denia band karo saaleo
731	5	a	I had this game on my kindle and it just disappeared. I finally found it on my phone after 2 years of looking. I love this game, although I do wish there was a special level for a baby nursery that bred different kinds of babies that have different abilities. I would also think it would be cool to see them crawling around from floor to floor. :)
732	1	a	هذا البرنامج ضعيف لازم توقفوه
733	5	a	Fantastic game, played through it in one day. All for under two dollars! Wish there were more of this type out there, can't wait for the sequel.
734	4	a	Great App, but there is no pause option.
735	5	a	Amazing quality really pleased I would recommend it to everyone.
736	5	a	Excellent game that is very addictive.  Starts off easy enough but the difficulty gradually increases and the later levels can be very challenging.  Was sorry to complete it but still play.

739	3	a	Seems to have stopped working on Pie and Pixel XL 2.
740	4	a	A fun distraction. Although some of the words the app does not seem to have knowledge of is surprising, it is on the whole a good game and an amusing distraction. Second time around not much has changed still fun
741	5	a	This theme is so cute and everyone that sees it complements it.
742	1	a	Useless. Complicated registration unable to correct, blocked out for no reason.
743	1	a	Just downloaded and keeps telling me that no movies found please help me
744	4	a	This game is really good guys. But there is a glitch where instead of doing damage to the enemy, you heal them with every blow. Please fix this because now its literally impossible to win. FIX THIS MARTI!!!
745	1	a	Clunky glitchy.. Graphics below average.. Booted out just played for 5 minutes.. The list goes on.. Sry but have to delete.
746	2	a	"This is the most fun and voice is pleasant.  One of my favorites! It's been awhile since I rated.  Now they acknowledge winning or its an \connection lost \"" so you lose.

747	5	a	I am really blessed :)
748	5	a	I can play this all the day without getting bored
749	4	a	It is very good but the ad r very annoying

763	5	a	Excellent game I own it on PC and got this for on the move and it is great.
764	1	a	Worthless because you cannot enter more than one thing with the same product name and some field definitions are too limited.
765	4	a	I just got it...  I like it alot.  So many changes can be made...  Add sounds for 5 stars
766	1	a	after the recent update the game doesn't open anymore
767	5	a	Just wanna to stop or pause the timer when i gotta be busy in anything away of study or work 😅
768	1	a	Nonsense app Waste of MB
769	4	a	Very  fun but to get past journey  level  which I think the 4th or 5th level u need to pay a dollar :(
770	1	a	Worst thing ever don't download waste of time
771	3	a	I agree with another some others ,it's to bad that you can't skip phrase if you can't get it, even after you use up all of your coins. I suppose I won't be playing much because I refuse to pay to play your game.

775	1	a	What happened to my favorite game??? Adds are causing all of us to uninstalling this now that someone seems to have turned greedy! Boo and shame on you!!!
776	5	a	Só o fato desse aplicativo existir já é um passo a frente. O novo layout e possibilidade de se cadastrar pelo próprio aplicativo foram realmente bem vindos.
777	5	a	Nice. Simple for decor my home screen... Thanks..
778	5	a	Love it  fun fun.
779	5	a	Dakheelak ya Abbas . Its so beautiful masha allah. Thank you great job
780	1	a	I had 9,000 credits. Took awhile. Then decided to just play instead of stopping after a few spins in order to keep my credits.  Took them all in about 5 minutes.  I refuse to have to constantly buy in order to play 😠
781	5	a	Exactly what I was looking for. I hate the pre-installed wallpapers on the Photon 4G. Too busy, too bright, too distracting from what's on the screen. This is nice, clean, and very simple. Thank you!
782	1	a	Team viewer has lock my account again I give up our company will even look \nfor a different solution.
783	3	a	Only put 3 stars cuz I listened and never pressed the button 😂
784	5	a	It does what it says it does.  No more, no less.  No phone access needed(as I would hope).  Exactly what I needed to fill an Android gap.
785	4	a	Worked great. I wanted to record myself while sleeping to see if I snored.  Picked up everything.  No snoring but I noticed I toss and turn alot, could here the covers moving.... lmao
786	2	a	Ad blocks info at bottom of page. Hard to navigate. And didn't make it easy to compare stats
787	5	a	Best app really charging fast thanks for mobility studio's...
788	5	a	Variations of what my life looks like in creative, different views - just like me!! Thanks for such a great bug free camera app....
789	4	a	This game takes up a lot of space
790	2	a	Slow movement speed, the range on the guns is terrible to actually get a kill you have to be stood on thier toes then when you go to shoot you don't or you miss the button cause its too small and you die. Just a few things to patch then I may buy this game.
791	3	a	I cannot login on my Nexus 5 since it is upgraded to Android 6.
792	1	a	dont waste your time in this game.
793	3	a	All in all a very nice game. Maybe people and more cars would make it more fun. Graphics are very good and car movement very realistic. Good game.
794	5	a	Its great friends its Amazing speed
795	1	a	" introducing a new character every level? I barely even get to know them before they're gone. and also i shouldnt have to like your Facebook page just to get past chapter 2 i will like your page if and when i decide i enjoy it. Don't farm for likes"""
796	3	a	Its ok but could be better
797	5	a	بهترین چیزیه که تا الان دانلود کردم
798	1	a	Listen people this app is a waste of time DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.      You will Want to delete it after you download it
799	4	a	Like the game, would love a reset button
800	3	a	Play is OK but the deals are often very similar and there is no way to turn over the deck when you get to the end of the pack.
801	1	a	While registration,  showing already registered ( mobile number \u0026 e-mail id )......no option to search login id and get the password. ..no option of forgot password. .
802	2	a	Good function. But too much advertise
803	5	a	Odlicna aplikacija,  jednostavna i brza, ne ukljucujte video nemam vremena zangubljenje, procitam sve vesti za 10 minuta i to je to, ne upropascavajte osecaj kao ostali sa videom.
804	3	a	Save data and save battery
805	1	a	I couldn't pull up my keyboard to type
806	1	a	Up to a few days ago it was fantastic 5 stars. The app depends on the font setting on the phone so if the font is too large it cannot display properly. My font settings are medium and the app always worked well with those settings. Now all of a sudden the app display because extra large and useless even with the fonts still on medium settings. I called BOV customer service but they have no clue.
807	4	a	Would love to have a group view
808	3	a	I just wish it let you skip puzzles that are too tedious, and that it would save game play in the middle of a level instead of making you restart the level if you quit in the middle.
809	3	a	But does not load :(
810	5	a	Smooth, interactive explosions of light. On 2 different views  in space. One of my favs!
811	1	a	Completely crashed my HTC Desire HD (2.3) when loading a level. Last crash was so bad I had to remove battery to restart the phone.
812	3	a	Its like okk....but i just wanna give u some suggestions to improve it... 1. It would be good if there would be an option to customize the character cuz most of the people look the same . 2. There should have been blocks of more colours and more furnitures . I AM ALSO FACING A PROBLEM IN WHICH THE CHARACTER CANT MOVE MANY A TIMES AND IT GETS DISCONNECTED ON ITS OWN . If these problems are fixed then this game would get a better review .  THANKS
813	1	a	It doesn't work after putting nailpaint
814	3	a	Starting of the game all is japannese I can't understand that language
815	5	a	I love this game and when I was little l loved horses and they are very interesting
816	5	a	I love it so much that I can't st playing it
817	5	a	Works great, had no problems on my g2 with T- mobile. Thanks.
818	5	a	Love wolf's I draw them I have one named chojy he is a Alaskan gray wolf
819	1	a	Why there isnt PSG Thats why I give it 1 star
820	1	a	I am not downloading anything from you people because from what I have read this is NOT working for anyone so u guys should fix this. And I would NOT recommend downloading from this company to ANYONE!
821	1	a	Why is it so hard for all of these developers to make a decent video player? this piece of junk will not let you Loop video, immediately jumps back to the playlist after the one play through, which is not sufficient, keeps display artifacts on screen during playback which blocks clear viewing of what your image is, and crashes far too often. don't waste your time.
822	5	a	Works great free version, but I beleive I need to upgrade it to get better pics.l Galaxy 3
823	5	a	Chilling shoot I love it because it reminds me of my friends Cory and it is real fun so thank you guys for making this game
824	3	a	Like more colours please and plz fix orientation issue x10 mini pro ta..
825	5	a	I just wish they had another or more pictures to draw
826	3	a	As I expected based on screenshots. Good selection of settings though. Glad I could find my custom background image; many apps I've tried failed On Android 5.1.1 nexus 6.
827	5	a	Их гоё апп бна. Өөр олон телевизийг оруулаарай
828	4	a	I expected a cheap slider game buy this is a really fun game to just kill time with.
829	5	a	Good game but crashes a lot
830	5	a	매우 좋음 , 데이터 안씀, 딴거 할수 있음
831	5	a	I absolutely love wolves and If I here or see anything wolf I go CRAZY!!!! Wolves are the best things that ever happened to the WORLD. If you hate wolves. I hate you!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am the number one fan of wolves, I will die for them!!!!!
832	1	a	I go on the game and it turns off! If this happens to you, I'm not surprised :-(
833	2	a	I can't figure out how to play it like I just walk all I seen was a chicken and a rabbit that was it. It's very confusing.
834	3	a	Ada sih beberapa level yg nama katanya yg gak terlalu berhubungan dngn gambar2 yg ada. Tp ini sih udah bagus. Banyakin yah levelnya
835	1	a	Every time I try to open the app, my screen freezes. It only let me play 2 rounds.
836	1	a	can only cast to vlc on a pc. had no option to scan network for devices
837	5	a	Very good app. You can really see your Lego sets come to life.
838	5	a	Fantastic. Best for videos.....like even 1080p.The best I've used do far. Only thing is, when I play video as 'audio only' and put it on repeat, it repeats only once as audio, after which it plays for the second time as a video and then stops. So that's mighty uncomfortable when I want a video to be played as an audio on repeat nonstop until I stop it.
839	5	a	Just love everything about it.
840	1	a	Oh no...crap I've been send you PM but nothing happened with every 3 different application... I hope this you evaluate a bit my own issue ...if this app supported an old ver 4.4.2 blu dash c music..while loading keep popped up operation timeout crap..
841	4	a	is great and addictive but some of the equipment the at they used in the car parks wasn't realistic but it is a great game apart from when you get frustrated! overall a good game...
842	4	a	I'm upon the game but didn't get to enjoy it
843	1	a	Why does the app need to make PHONE CALLS? Works ok to find loo's on SGS.
844	5	a	I love that I get notifications before isafyi!  Motivates me to   cycle!!!!!!
845	1	a	No working, i uses the sos fuction, but nvm call back. Useless
846	5	a	Love this game. Good choice of background and dice. Dice are easy to read.
847	5	a	My daughter could be separated from spaghetti and marinara sauce. Which is almost impossible!
848	4	a	It's really cute ! Need more animal print themes ! Thanks
849	1	a	폰 스크린만 끌수 있지 웹보다 좋은게 하나도 없음 첫번째로 로딩속도가 너무 느림. 그리고 확대축소도 안되고. 느린건 극혐
850	1	a	Lot of reviews here saying this; great show terrible app. Good news tho you can catch TAL on free podapps like castbox etc.
851	5	a	Feature 1: allow to freeze wallpaper and change it manually Feature 2: allow to add some wallpapers to a favourite list so I can revert them. Sometimes it generates some very cool wallpapers and it's a shame I can't store them
852	4	a	Great! Awesome! What a game. Seems like game developers put their every effort to make this game entertaining. One thing which is missing is the graphics. Those are not as per game intensity, especially blood shown. \u0026 how to play previous stages? Please fix everything. All the best guys. \u0026 please if possible, I am waiting for a sequel of this game. Please release it as soon as possible...
853	5	a	The graphics on this are really impressive for a cell phone game. There are some relatively minor differences from the tabletop version and it is harder. But for whatever it's worth, I have not lost on easy, and win about half the time on medium and hard. It helps to find the right strategy and combination of characters. :) But sometimes even then you get unlucky with dice rolls.
854	3	a	Please make the carrier easier
855	5	a	Its really awesome \u0026 cute theme. Loved the change in messaging \u0026 calling pattern..
856	5	a	Alhamdulillah...the best for me...thanks...may Allah bless u...
857	5	a	נהדר, רק ללחוץ על טעינה ולא צריך יותר כלום, וגם קיבלתי שני מעדנים חינם, תענוג : )
858	1	a	THIS APP IS HORRIBLE!  YOU NEED TO MAKE IT LIKE THE ONE FOR IPHONES!
859	4	a	I played with the app and put the pic on insta and everyone thought I was dressed up for some special occasion!   Lol!
860	4	a	It is what I've Ben looking for, however the clock font changes randomly. Like the hour would show in one font and the minutes would display in a different font.
861	5	a	Really good game, I am no longer bored. The fish are cute and the goal is simple
862	5	a	Because it has the  blue crazy bird
863	5	a	شكرا على هذا التطبيق ..
864	4	a	Very good but please include tables up to 20. Landscape orientation is annoying on phone.
865	5	a	Dragonfly is the first dragon game I've played.  My big brother played this game once, my sister and I have it. This game gets five stars. This game is fantastic!
866	5	a	Amazing game Fun for hours. I'm so bad but I can easily reach four thousand metres. I wish there were more choices of paint jobs and power ups in the in-game store. For example you should be able to choose your own paint job or decals in the same way you can in black Ops three. Definitely. Deserves five stars either way
867	4	a	I love it very much because I can make my own music
868	1	a	It won't work with a real SJCAM SJ4000, but it's not supposed to.
869	5	a	I spent a few hours making a few tracks. When I came back to it it saved the drums as a piano... And I can't get it back to a drum track... It was amazing before that happened
870	4	a	Не хватает выделения строк цветом,подчеркивания.
871	5	a	I love this app !  When Im feeling bad, I feel better after I type the prayer...and every prayer request has been answered through the Lord Jesus. I love how the prayers go out to the whole world !   My only request is that I could delete the prayer from MY phone. That way my family will never see the struggles I had, if they happen to get into my phone.  If I could also delete it from your (server ?), that would be ok, too... I wouldnt delete it till the problem no longer needs to be prayed for...because God hears and answers prayers, and soon the problems are solved.  Thank you so much for this app!
872	3	a	controls are horribly placed,and because of that i am giving it 3 stars
873	5	a	It's a good game and fun
874	3	a	When I try and take a picture it takes about 5-7 seconds to actually capture the image and then you t ends up blurry because I moved cause I thought it instantly took it. (Using HTC sensation 4g) also how do i capture video cant seem to work it out.                     Other than that great app. Please fix this issue and I'll rate 5 stars
875	1	a	Terrible Pls Do Not Install Worst Game Ever!!!
876	5	a	Es super entretenido yo no paro de jugar
877	5	a	Good tivizen is work in cyprus now  !!!
878	4	a	I'd be comfortable calling this RPG average. It's not anything special but for the price you definitely getting a lot of game. I don't really have any major complaints, but there's nothing that made me say wow this is the best game ever.  don't expected to redefine the genre, but if you're in the mood for an RPG this will certainly do. One nice thing is there aren't any microtransactions, so that's nice.
879	1	a	I paid for this app and now it won't even open...Ok..please fix it
880	5	a	have used for my heart condition and find it quite accurate. like that u can save the results thanks.
881	5	a	Cool game.  But how do u play with ur friends? The code says it doesnt exist...all the time
882	4	a	It's a pretty good time killer and its entertaining. Passing the levels is easy. Then you can go back and try to par all of them
883	5	a	Very nice app happy so far with it
884	3	a	Great idea but lacks silent reporting! For example when a person is in danger and can't talk for personal safety reasons. I would be happy with registration system which could identify me and my location on a button click.
885	5	a	You guys r my favorite ppls  for games I turn to you guys great hd graphics  and make maps and dens to live in and caves with batsss and plzzzzzzzz make a town map and make you customize your character size and details make story line it would be helpful and put in the game a easter egg great game any way
886	5	a	It's so cute, and I really like how I can customize the messages~ I use it to talk myself out of stupid things like pulling all nighters for no reason xD
887	4	a	Would be awesome if more meds could be added for dose computations, like izoniazid, rifampicin, etc.
888	5	a	Great app.great graphics.thanks to developer
889	5	a	I love that I can check in in real time.
890	4	a	I love this game! The enviroment, the serious mood, and the gameplay is fresh enough that no other game comes to mind while playing this one. The only detail is the bugs, i AM playing on a moto g (which by now can be considered ancient) but sometimes the framerate drops and my taps don't register, causing me to die often. Anyway, my compliments to the developer! Keep up the good work! You should be peoud of it!
891	4	a	Easy application procedure and quick response
892	5	a	You can point it directly south then turn it 180° around and it says east? Inacurate!
893	4	a	Good and simply nice game for kids✌✌
894	5	a	Its good it has otber games when ur bored it nice lovley
895	1	a	After last update stop working. Before that was good. please fix it.I'm using subscribed  version.
896	5	a	One of the more challenging point and click puzzlers I been playing lately which makes it worth the money. Not hard enough that it makes you completely stuck but did forget about a puzzle box in one of the rooms which the hint guide reminded me of. Only had to get that one hint the rest I was able to work out when running back and forth. You do end up with a few items that I never used. I felt very satisfied when I completed the game and will definitely buy episode 2.
897	3	a	Huawei mate 8 does not work: load colour setting
898	5	a	This app is wonderful my 1 year old loves it and she singing her abc \nalready😘😊
899	4	a	Gosto de ver as reportagens bem antes de elas passarem aqui pela record em meu país Moçambique. Falta a funçao dowload.
900	4	a	"The only reason they lost a star is because sometimes when using the \back\"" arrow it doesn't erase as many lines as drawn. I use it for my son to practice his letters and my oldest to practice his spelling. Makes it more fun!"""
901	4	a	This was the only app that did what I wanted it to do. But now my notification bar is gone and I don't know how to make it visible
902	5	a	I love these poems there so romantic and so sweet for people
903	1	a	A poorly designed UI, frequently changes the data you've previously entered (resulting in wild temperatures if you dont catch it), and spends ages failing to load and sync data between myself and my wife's app.
904	5	a	Very nice , super, fantastic and awesome game
905	1	a	It said I had to download the newest app. But it keeps saying installing and it's been doing that for over a week. I loved the app before I used it everyday.
906	3	a	Update and add lock at home screen which is wallpapers wont scroll and put it into auto fit. Can add and erase home screen widgets also can rename admin and guest profile(s) another thing, can add and erase picture in selected profile and also can set wifi on and off per profile. By the way make it portrait view by selecting account profile. It is easy to view instead of landscape. Thanks developer for improvement just try some update and fix others bugs. I like the developers concept on this app😆
907	4	a	This game is very fun and straight demo Derbyshire but unfortunately there are only 6 tracks and an easy medium and hard level for.each and there is only a couple cars so it's boring after a day :/
908	5	a	This game is very and fun and easy to play
909	3	a	Good graphics. The movement should be fixed. The store should be more plentiful and we should be able to buy things with a time limit or something. I believe there should be like a minigame or something to help pass time.    Other than that i loved the app. I love the story and how it leads your mind down roads of what has happened. Sure is nice to pass time. If these things were fixed i would rate it 4*.
910	5	a	I need to run presentations on Office 2011 for Mac.  I wanted to control them from my Android.  The app met this need perfectly.  After installing the server app on my laptop, I added it to Accessibility Settings.  That allowed me to control slides over WiFi and Bluetooth.  It worked so well, I purchased Pro.
911	5	a	This app is amazing!!! It makes my phone emit photons - the fastest things in the universe! At night, I can go outside and point these photons into the sky and know that they will be traveling forever through space - or maybe after a million thousand years they’ll bump into one of those other flashlights I see up there. All because of this little app. Amazing! Five stars.
912	1	a	90 percent adds 10% game
913	2	a	I really don't know the point of this app. I think it's great for people \nbuying books or music but I download plug-ins for pc. So this app is \nuseless for me. If al least I could manage my store and get notifications \nabout what I'm selling. It needs some rework
914	1	a	The Dice is not moving only..!! Guess not supporting d device or nythin.
915	5	a	Have you ever just laid on your back, in a park, in the middle of the night, with the one you love,  looking straight up into the sky, but the clouds, (of course), have gone to bed long before, the weather was perfect, the one beside you is singing John Lennon songs, and you had fallen in love, so completely?
916	1	a	How can I see what I have just snapped please
917	5	a	Very nice looking clock and gear works
918	3	a	I am now using the vTiger 6 crm and works fine. This app is ok but not nearly enough power to do what I need. There are a lot of windows that don't go all the way. It needs many more search applications and you cannot use everything the way you need to. I paid over 20.00 US which is about 30.00 Canadian. I now find out they are giving this app away. I asked them when they were going to have the fixes and they told me that they will with the new vTiger version that's now out. They just came out with the new beta app and I asked where to download it. They told me that only the users of their upgraded crm can have the new mobile version. I don't understand. I paid 30.00 cdn and need it working better. At least they could do is give me the new version as they are giving them away. I'm going to give the CRM a 4 of 5 but the mobile app much less for not only the problems with it but the way in which they charged me, then gave it away and then not provide me with the update of the app that is now supposed to fix the problem for the one I paid for. I think they should provide it to me for free and then I'll give them a better mark if it works better than the last one. vTiger should help.
919	2	a	I need this app for my project on physical fitness but I can install it.
920	1	a	It won't let me do MY SETTINGS!!!!!
921	1	a	Just bad, boring, and frustrating
922	5	a	Elegant, easy to use and low on system resources. One small thing I would really like to see is an option to centre-align the text. Great job guys/gals. God bless.
923	3	a	Cuesta llegar a lo que uno quiere. Falta interfaz maw intuitiva.
924	5	a	I love this game its an adorable game I rate this games FIVE stars.I dont hate a thing.
925	5	a	add multiplayer mode five player's please i rate the game five star's please add multiplayer mode
926	1	a	It doesn't run in my phone karbonn A2
927	1	a	Can't see anywhere to log in to my account.
928	4	a	I like the game because it gives my  bones coin
929	5	a	Can play any video file types...
930	2	a	Teraz aplikacja nie chce działać bez uprawnień do wykonywania połączeń, \nrobienia zdjęć i pobierania lokalizacji. Ale ja chcę tylko sprawdzać stan \nkonta. Jak zwykle ficzery wciskane na siłę
931	1	a	if you select hangup, the call just ring through. doesn't work. the only app that hangup works is the extreme call blocker.
932	5	a	It's the best very challenging and could become addictive
933	5	a	Nice theme. I love the transparency. But when using PAC the transparency of status bar goes away and it becomes black. Never mind, take 5 stars for s good free theme!!!
934	1	a	very Bad totally time weast
935	1	a	I had this on my Galaxy 3 and I loved it I installed it on my Galaxy S5 and I can't put a picture please fix
936	5	a	Oh my god, the funniest game ever, me and my brother make mini tournaments with each other to see who can make it the farthest, we both fail at this game but it is so funny. Thank you for your time and making a great game!
937	1	a	That your like a x e flatulence a x e x axe 🙅🙅🙅~T_T~~T_T~
938	5	a	Nice and Really loved to play it.
939	5	a	Great game, hours of fun!
940	3	a	No way to pay to remove them. Exp is earned at a slower rate than the 3rd one. Overall a good, free game.
941	5	a	Very great, I really recommend it a lot 💖
942	5	a	I just want a relationship that the only thing you should know by the time I saw at a very nice of him as he has to do is make it easier on me to do is make it easier for the first to know about it is the most part of this email to you and your family have
943	1	a	crashed all the time. Stock Samsung s4 mini android 4.4.1.
944	1	a	Shows the intro logo and the screen goes black.
945	5	a	Its so adorable and cool
946	4	a	Easy to use. But it won't install on a new phone.
947	1	a	Never DOWNLOAD this app,waste of data
948	1	a	Subscription doesn't give access to more content. Uninstalled and reinstalled and unable to get app to acknowledge subscription again. Removing permanently.
949	4	a	A good way to past the time
950	5	a	MSN is one of my favorite news sites. It presents various points of view which allows the reader to consider them all. The new media in the US is the best in the world and does an outstanding job of providing the facts. I read as much as possible and ferret out the truth for myself. Thanks, keep up the good work.
951	5	a	Fun game. Lots of levels to play.
952	2	a	I used this app with my SONY Xperia phone and tried connecting it to SONY wireless headphones and didn't work. I don't know how Sony would allow this app to go to market if not 100% compatible and fully functional.
953	5	a	Exallent Game you have I will like to play it      Thanks
954	1	a	Doesn't save edited videos and just stops working! Waste of time
955	4	a	Love your game.Not too easy \u0026 not too hard. AND NO TIMER to stress  you out. And no Having to start  all over like some do. Thank you \u0026 keep em coming.
956	4	a	This is the best parking game
957	4	a	This game made me think and overall it was cool, until i had to pay for the full version. Boy bah
958	1	a	No place to create account,  low graphic,  no first time use manual... Don't waist your time on this app
959	5	a	I, AM SO,  THRILLED,  HAPPY \u0026 BLESSED! TO HAVE FOUND THIS APP, FOR THE PERFECT HEBREW LANGUAGE!!! YESHUA, ABA YAHWAE \u0026 OUR LANGUAGE! WE WILL ALL SPEAK, AGAIN SOON!  THANK. YOU! ALL MY LOVE!!! CYNTHIA M. ROSSER-SHAY
960	1	a	Utter garbage. Why even bother releasing something this bad. Awful awful game. Never ever download this game. The only saving grace is it can be uninstalled
961	1	a	I can't figure out how to get it on pictures?? So confused.
962	5	a	Thank you for this app!! I can play all day and with all the colours to choose from, it will keep me busy till I find my 'happy' and can start painting 😉 for real. I am telling every one about this app.
963	5	a	I think so when they say something to others you should add sound
964	1	a	Uninstalling because ads are starting to pop up during gameplay... disappointing...
965	2	a	I'm about to give 5 stars. But the CPU usage is not working. Widget or \nnotification, stays in 0% all the time. There is one specific thing I need \nto do?
966	2	a	Notes of some chapters are missing after electro statics. On clicking they just gives a blank screen.
967	4	a	There's not room enough here to tell you evverything. Suffice it to say that my replaced HTC ONE M-8, along with an almost concurrrent system update/update (three hours and 500-plus megabytes later I'm finally discovering why the HTC One M-8 won the2014 best new phone award. I expect that 5th star to manifest itself very soon.NOW I'm impressed!!! :B.W.Fisher.
968	3	a	I prefer bakery story but this game is OK. Food seems to take longer to cook and then spoils quickly. I enjoy that you can have neighbors and request materials and send or receive gifts. The decorations seem to be a bit expensive but so far it's OK.
969	4	a	I liked it but i didnt play it XD¿
970	5	a	I-i- can't explain it's  good
971	5	a	This one is just super. Some very different.
972	1	a	Auto renew cancelled a year ago by a justcloud consultant via email however \nI just received an email starting the account will auto renew again this \nyear. Be wary of paying for this service as it is difficult to cancel your \nsubscription. Thumbs down for customer support / service
973	5	a	This is so good and pucks you up if ur down ♥
974	5	a	I love it.  Please, please, please do more blue steampunk designs!!!
975	5	a	This app has already been very helpful at the property management company where I work and they are rolling out new features all the time! I can't wait to see what they come up with next!
976	2	a	1 Doesn't show 98 octane. 2 Doesn't show on a map, just an address list, until you make a selection.
977	5	a	It is amazing wallpaper. Its works great on my samung Galaxy Tab. I love it! !
978	5	a	Ang ganda ng laro nato.
979	5	a	She grown enough to try to speak to me in English words. Just bits and pieces, but she is still very shy. Also, she move a bit more comfortably. She love me.
980	5	a	It's a good game if you like solving the logos and it's like a memory game.
981	1	a	You have ruined the functionality of the app that I have used for years. The two decimal place format is useless it should atleast go to 4 places minimum.
982	1	a	"Says its free then I click \free\"" and it sends me to a blank page... Not worth the time"""
983	5	a	Sounds reasonable with different beat options. Easy to manoeuvre and change the different tempo amd speed.
984	5	a	A lot more information on how you feel that way to the next day I was just thinking that it would have a few of them have been in a few days ago but have no clue where you live human resources to help you out for you are interested please just send the message to us by replying please let you have a few minutes and we were able and the kids to bed and then the following file for you are interested please just send the message to the next day I was just thinking that we have been in a while and it will not
985	5	a	You are a genius and bring so much pleasure to a lot of people. And its free. Looking forward to any new 3D wallpapers.....soon please. Thank you.
986	1	a	Connection freezes after 16Mb and has never connected for 3 continuous hours even for the paid version. Requesting full refund
987	4	a	So I'm guessing this game is some kind of political commentary involving a juxtaposition of capitalism and socialism. But what's that? Did I notice a comment on today's situation in Ukraine? I say, this piece of art is most puzzling
988	3	a	Cute game but you must make the games free please we all would appreciate it a lot . . And forget about the money because all the other games like my talking Tom are free
989	5	a	Ad-free, one simple task and does it well.
990	5	a	Going to use this everyday at work
991	5	a	Really helpful ...recommended for all frequent flyers
992	2	a	Lots of bugs.  Fonts are not USA, but some foreign language that one cannot understand.  Deletes whole words instead of a character.  Also puts two characters instead of one.  Lot of bugs that need to be fixed.  Keyboard is too large to see what you are working on.  Sizing up or down is difficult
993	3	a	This game has an old school 2D side scroller style to it. Has a Dynasty Warriors hack n' slash feel to it as well. One of the enemies knocked me off the path into the backdrop and I couldn't get the character back in the game. All I could do is walk past all the enemies ha!  Samsung Note 2
994	1	a	Says its free, but then charges you to apply. What's the point of the ads then? Rip off. Don't advertise for free if it ain't!
995	5	a	I really like this game it is a lot of fun!
996	1	a	They are getting paid to vote 5 stars so do not believe that they are real.
997	5	a	I love the fact that the 3 tests are so simple to follow and they are fun and engaging. I asked my mum to try it and I said to follow the on-screen instructions. She was a lot slower though but it was funny. I am so addicted to this game even though sometimes I get so angry because I want to beat my score. I hate the fact that people go into the config and change their score so they get 1st place but you just can't stop people from hacking. The ads are OK because there isn't many. I love the colour sceme :)
998	5	a	Its very good. ...need thousands of questions.
999	5	a	Iv been trying to open my game for3days it won't come up iv played the game for years ty
1000	3	a	More description needed for little ones to know how to play. Very entertaining for them once it has been figured out.
1001	5	a	We can take all the design even offline that is much helpful for me that's why i loved it
1002	2	a	I love cribbage but this game is so unrealistic. The hands dealt are way too good for a 2 player game. The AI consistently gets perfect turn cards for its hand whereas the human side very rarely gets a decent card. Very frustrating to be 20 points ahead only to end up losing by 15 or more. RNG really needs some serious tweets to make this game better.
1003	1	a	Such a boring game i ts control s are bad very bad. I love pc s road rash but its a total copy of this it. And its give sooo many ads . it gives ads more than the game
1004	5	a	61500000 on the 7x7 grid, about 2 months and I still going, on so far so good

1018	1	a	So despite the fact I have an Accor login, this app insists I check in via Facebook, and won't even open unless I give it access to my friends list, despite this being 'optional'. Instant uninstall.
1019	5	a	Nice time killer. The illustrations are also great, I just really wish they'd do more.
1020	5	a	Great game but you should add more vehicles to drive and different maps
1021	5	a	Never did I expect the crew of the Bahamas to be so broken. Everyone changed, but realistically so. M is more mature, N seems to have some PTSD, K is losing it, T seems to be hiding pain, C is more prone to anger and violence. This is the most well written visual novel I have ever read. Keep up the good work.
1022	4	a	I see the reaper meteors but I only see the edge of the background image. I'm using a Acer android tablet if that helps. [But i do see how cool this could be so 4 stars].
1023	5	a	It does get a little confused by some websites eg. Whilst looking at the headlines page of The Independent the app decided to ready the £500,000+ property section instead. On the whole very useful tool though.
1024	5	a	I love this game very very much!Like it!
1025	3	a	This game not like another duty driver...i hope you make this game like duty driver...i will rate 5 star if you fulfil my hope...thank you...add headlight and refine the interior...
1026	5	a	The best app for Amharic Bible by far, especially the daily verses!

And find your friend that have the same app and . That would be great that I would pay for . Thank you and good jod. Keep up the good jod your doing.
1038	3	a	Its a great thing to use but. sometimes i push the right answer and then at the end it says i pick another answer. I also dont like how i cant go back on the test
1039	4	a	Enjoy but would like a 10 min option
1040	4	a	I must have found a strange glitch. I was able to purchase far more than one special elder habitat. Little did I know, you cannot sell them a after being placed. This is a bad deal. No more room on my islands, and no new islands to buy, that isn't good.

1047	5	a	Awesome dude..i love so much...this app...!!!  To many heart touching.. Quotation...!!!
1048	2	a	The animation quality is not up to par with today's standards. The search loading is pretty fast tho. Doesn't show events from what I could see. The UI seems outdated to say the least. The idea is good, just create a better app 😉

1060	4	a	Brilliant App, very good functionality for the price! Free!!!
1061	4	a	It really gives you an edge...if you use your discretion and logic then the app works great.
1062	2	a	Since u guys updated the game and bugs are rare I can't get uploads anymore bugs was the fastest way to get uploads and good weapons and stuff plz in the next update make bugs not rare anymore plz. If you do I'll give five stars
1063	3	a	Not very good when images you lock in gallery plus randomly unlock!!!!! No reply to my last comment not expecting one on this one. Mmm need to lock for another app
1064	5	a	I love this game so beautiful
1065	5	a	This game is, without getting into TO much detail, is the BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED ON ANDROID. EVER. The gameplay is pretty smooth except for the small ads at the bottom. Which brings me to my first suggestion. Make a paid ad-free version! I have a feeling a lot of people will buy it. Second, POWERUPS. There could be a time slow-down powerup, and a rare skip-level powerup. I would LOVE to see these in the game!    -Bigglez Inator
1066	3	a	Game is ok but lots of unwanted ads... als to end game is and start new game is not great
1067	3	a	I didn't give 5 stars because of wrong map of India
1068	1	a	HORRIBLE APPA. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT.
1069	1	a	Adverts every 5 spins. Garbage game play.
1070	4	a	But how to change language?

1074	2	a	You'll notice a very distinct change of difficulty when you hit level/wave 24 or 25 in the tournament. You definitely need to work on the levels getting harder at a more even pace otherwise not a bad game so far. I'd be happy to revise my feedback should this ever become resolved.
1075	5	a	I swear by this app!!
1076	3	a	if you could hide videos with out having to purchase anything it would be perfect.   hide it /audio app works the best and it's free

1089	1	a	It is not solving anything
1090	4	a	The setting button doesn't work.
1091	1	a	Galaxy s4. Game seems fun but at the end of every race so far the app has crashed to home screen. Hate to give the low review but it's not working for me.  Also notifications from app cannot be disabled within app.
1092	3	a	I figured you could just press play and listen. These are more like comic skits. A change? Option to play \u0026 it goes to randoms. Or even better,  (although unsure if copyright laws are infringed) you can make a playlist of what you've seen
1093	1	a	Would have given 5 stars but wish I could give zero. I paid to unlock whole game and was fine til level 21, stopped working properly. Knew I was playing correctly but having got so far paid for help through the level  ( which cost MORE than the game itself!!! ) This confirmed that I had been right and the game was at fault. I decided to restart the level and it wanted me to pay AGAIN for the help I already paid for, frustrating bullshit swindle of a game-AVOID IF YOU DON'T WANNA BE FRUSTRATED
1094	1	a	Just downloaded this today and i was really enjoying it but the game forced closed on me 4 times in 20 min. Sucks!
1095	1	a	Had a Spot connect for years and hoped it would get better, didn't happen. Made many suggestions to them on how to improve and spoke to reps at demos. They are not supporting product quotes from sales reps. Better and safer to use Google Mape then Spot and they support and update it. I gave up when the satellite message service which worked very slow stopped working. I feel this could be a great product again if they went to a sat sleeve type product with battery attached to cellphones. Until sorry Spot.
1096	5	a	I can't get past level 25. Someone help please. I even found the clue but I don't understand it. Please help. For the ones In level 22,  you should find something under the carpet and then use their colors and in level 16, you should shake your phone and tap the guy at the same time. The people that are stuck on upper levels and are asking for help, help the ones on the lower levels first.

1104	1	a	Good idea ...does not recognise Irish addresses

1115	5	a	Very good graphics and, as always, game play. Candy Crush Saga has nothing to even come close :-D
1116	5	a	Absolutely fun single player game.  You can get ship blueprints from enemy fleets without buying money.  But buying money from start will give you a nice advantage. Only thing is that I wish this had multiplayer and PvP in it.
1117	1	a	A fantastic twist on this style of game. However, many of the answers are very ambiguous. For example, a picture of the Roman coliseum could be history, coliseum, Rome, ruins... the word is past. An event at the rodeo could be calf, cow, race, rodeo...  it's rope. A speaker could be loud, speaker, music.. it's membrane. Maybe I just think and see things differently to most people...
1118	5	a	The instructions are sort of lacking but if you are willing to try it out you will not be disappointed. Don't be afraid to experiment. Anything you do can be undone in 1 or 2 clicks. And sometimes you don't get a paste notification but trust me. It is pasted  Mike
1119	3	a	After playing the game a few times thought it was pretty good and liked it. Then as I ordered the fourth track at a thousand dollars of hard earned gameplay dollars, it never gave me my next track and took my money. Thinking this may have been a glitch after playing a few more times, I ordered the next track again but still got ripped so sorry I am going to delete this one and go elsewhere. Hope u fix this bug and maybe months down the road I will try it again. Sorry, MARTY.

I don't experience this problem with other apps.

1128	5	a	Very nice and good collection. Sound quality is excellent. Artist wise more collection will be good. Similar type of bengali song collection, if possible,will also be very nice.
1129	3	a	Nice game .It should be more realistic.Trucks can be better.Although it is good.
1130	1	a	i HATE push message adv.  NO option in the setting to opt out receiving ur push message is the reason why I uninstalled it

I have emailed y'all several times and keep getting the same bullshit response from y'all. Either fix it or refer me to an app that really works when off home network.
1133	2	a	This app can't even do what a real chess timer can do and thats change yhe settings.   I shouldn't have to go in and set up multiple game profiles to just modify a time setting.   It says I can delete stuff but the function is broken.  Kinda lame.  Further more, chess clocks are used for more than just chess, I couldn't give a load about the various speed chess styles.

If your expecting for new things to work on your old outdated tech maybe you do not have common sense. Plz buy the game no disappointments here. Plz make more games. If you gave it 1star ik your software is old so don't bother making a rate or comments it's known not to work on outdated software. Technology only advances

And once it is in safemode. You can have easy access to private and personal information without needing any passwords.
1154	2	a	Constant cheating by the computer ruins this great game. I will control 3 territories and only reinforce with 12 troops, while the computer reinforces with 24 troops, despite holding zero territories, and defeats me. This just happened in the game I was playing after only 5 turns. Until this is fixed, I cannot justify purchasing the full game.

1164	1	a	O teste é muito impreciso e após atualizar não consigo fazer teste algum. Belo trabalho hein?
1165	4	a	The game is fun and challenging... I only have two complaints... 1) playing in landscape makes the game hard to play one handed on larger phones .2) if you have to play in landscape, please make the game full screen so your thumb doesn't accidentally hit the softkeys in Android
1166	1	a	Installed, restarted phone, still not showing up. No clue what it's like because it doesn't work.
1167	5	a	It's like I taught Vinyl Scratch EVERYTHING SHE KNOWS!
1168	3	a	The vehicles are too stiff. I think more vehicles should be add as much as roads and levels. But its ok.
1169	4	a	It was a really fun game. It just gets kinda boring after you find you family and defeat the bosses. Also it would be better if the were different maps.
1170	5	a	REALLY COOL AND EDUCATIONAL. I LOVE YOU ALL DEVELOPERS !!!
1171	5	a	This app is great. Question are challenging and when I get a wrong answer the app gives me the right answer with detailed description and the chapter and page the answer came from.
1172	3	a	Nice idea.  Must see in person.  Usually pretty simple to find along the axis lines anyway.\tThose who complain about overworld fortresses, they are so easy to find. Ender eyes will show you the way.

1174	5	a	It's very challenging, but think some items are over hidden so a person needs to buy hints. Also some items are very small and it's hard to  tell what they are. It also close prematurely and you have to start over.

1181	4	a	Really good I like it very much please,make another free theme like this hehehe..
1182	2	a	Hi, i tried login with FB. after successful logon, empty black screen is appearing. when i pulled down the screen, app shows that it is refreshing but of no use. Blank screen appears always. Suggest how to use. my phone is Samsung Galaxy S Advance.
1183	5	a	It's world best 4D apps
1184	5	a	Makes you think. Hate when in have to move on to other things. But great way to kill time
1185	3	a	CalcBuddy's Default Skin has the most Realistic Looking Graphic User Interface, (GUI), but it lacks the Plus/Minus Change Sign, \u0026 the Percent Button, and a Separate Tape History Button, and bigger Text Size on the History would be more Readable. If CalcBuddy had a LandScape Mode, \u0026 put some Blue Color on the KeyPad and Color on the History Tape History, this would be a keeper. For an Expressions Calculator, I like the RDEV Calculator Better.

1187	1	a	It's a good app, but only allows limited use before it requires you to pay.  Maybe it's a common practice but I was caught off guard and disappointed.  I'm uninstalling.
1188	1	a	bikul barkar,time mat karab karo,fake,froud.....
1189	3	a	It is OK not the best. because it doesn't have enough pics . plz make more pics and I would be happy. It is also sleek boring. Who ever made this did OK not good but OK. Do not download .
1190	4	a	Needs to be able to remove custom timers.  On note 3 not possible.
1191	1	a	Garbage server error every time i try to register..
1192	5	a	This is one of the funnest live wallpapers I've ever had the pleasure of using! Other people love it too, and they're so intrigued when i show them that it turns sound to visuals... lovely app, you've done a very good job!
1193	5	a	I love this game so much but one thing can you guys update it today and anytime there is a new game coming out for kids send me a request
1194	5	a	Its was a monkey was very funny it was hated
1195	1	a	I download the eternity warrior 2 its alriqht no prob on my galaxy. and now I download this crap when I selecting characters it will gonna be loading but then it force closes. fix this crap guys! Uninstalling. waste of time!
1196	5	a	I  love  it   9    stars
1197	4	a	I have got all the levels that l can and it keeps on saying wait for the next update to build a new level. I have been waiting for about 4 months now but still no updates.  I'm still on level 61 and lm still waiting for a updated grrrr
1198	1	a	so much ads + the steering is laggy
1199	1	a	When you require an update to use this app, at least you should make it available first! So dumb. I wish i could give zero star.
1200	4	a	Its fun when there are times you have absolutely nothing else to do. It can also be challenging if you really got into it.
1201	5	a	The things are funny! It's also a very good game! Thethoor is mah fav. :3
1202	5	a	T says in the app description, excellent app so ill give it a perfect star   👍
1203	1	a	Razr Maxx continual crash... uninstalled
1204	3	a	Cool app but I'm getting really tired of the hot air balloon wallpaper. I would prefer weather animations based on actual local weather.
1205	4	a	A bit fiddly but is great to work stuff out to see if it works
1206	5	a	Superb.. 5 stars worth :)
1207	5	a	" very colorful puzzles and very easy for a 4 year old to navigate all the menus and puzzles easily."""
1208	4	a	It's good but coins must be added when you score more, so that we can buy new car from it.
1209	5	a	Loved  it so  much for the game.
1210	3	a	Would like to see  unlockable content as well as better sound effects. And a paid version...pop ups in the middle of game play \u003d fail.
1211	1	a	Sooooooooo,  I speak Spanish buti aint fluent.  You cant even chane the language. :/
1212	2	a	Horrible execution. There's no clear indicator of where you are, what's going on. π/∆.
1213	4	a	Love the videos that are posted daily. David gives some really in-depth insights into the astrological weather in a very no-nonsense way. David: PLEASE find an alternative to Lookstack! You're so talented and your work is too high-quality.  Sometimes the Lookstack platform warps/inappropriately sizes images for the video thumbnails. It's minor, but looks less professional.
1214	5	a	Goood snd i like yhis program
1215	5	a	It is a super dynamite background \u0026 sure worth the downdload. Very entertaining.
1216	5	a	Great addictive game. I do wish it would remember what I bought in the store. It keeps telling me to buy things that I already bought and it gets a little annoying. But the game is great. Plus it's worth the price. Everything else that can be bought at the shop uses the coins collected in the game. No additional fees or in app purchases. :)
1217	1	a	It was at 93 and then the number was  50 . . . . . . . It is not installing
1218	1	a	The app keeps telling me I have not logged on for 90 days, no matter how often I use it. Every time it asks for one-time password to confirm my device. I also have to activate fingerprint login every time I use the app. I'm about to lose my patience with the app
1219	4	a	This game is never boring. It's different every time.
1220	5	a	This is saving some memory of my device storage as it takes less space as compared to Cisco anyconnect client. Performance is good.
1221	3	a	"This app is really great but is constantly pissing me off because every time I accidentally move my phone sideways I have to start over. You only need the \to top\"" button. Take this feature off. I will be looking for a replacement app. This one thing is driving me away."""
1222	5	a	On HTC 820g+ simple app thank you developers
1223	5	a	I am a 10th grader and it is very helpful to me ,and I love that it explains it to me with the press of a button (better job than my teacher). I just think that for upper class men(11\u002612 or up) would need harder questions.
1224	5	a	Exactly what I needed for my 5 year old preschooler! This is everything and more!
1225	3	a	I mean from looking at the pics it looks fine
1226	1	a	I hate it doesn't do any thing but shows a picture
1227	5	a	It's been so long since I last played such an addictive game. Everything is amazing. I wish if there was some forums or something to discuss things or get advise. I completed the game but I still have some questions unanswered like the laser rifle, is there a special mine which will give required resources to make energy cell (like bullets using sulphur from sulphur mine). Is there some special mine for it.
1228	4	a	Nice simple app. Does what it says. Please add app2sd.
1229	2	a	Uninstalling. Developers you need to listen to the people they are right. You had me, I was willing to invest my money but you just don't listen to reason. Don't spend time or money on this particular game,you will get so far then happy farming.
1230	5	a	I love it, this is a app So perfect for potterheads
1231	3	a	Only thing that let me doen was the lag when i switched my phone on \nsleeping mode
1232	1	a	I love all the G5 games I bought and played. But I have to leave a negative review because I have written you 3 times for the past 3 weeks regarding this game wouldn't open; and there is no response up till to-date. Can you please fix this? (Am using Samsung Galaxy S8). I didn't have problem with any paid G5 games before. Thanks
1233	2	a	I just got this I want  to try it I  picked what dumpling and it said unfortunately dumplings has stop report or leave so  I'm deleting it :( ; ( ;.... (
1234	4	a	Addictive and fun gameplay, good graphics, and while some of the races are \ninfuriating, a few upgrades to your car fixes it. It's always satisfying \nwinning a race.
1235	4	a	Helps a lot with food ideas especially when you're new to eating healthy.
1236	3	a	I do like that this is flash friendly and easy to use. However I've been having certain problems; it doesn't always like to stay open for too long, or if I go to reuse it after letting it run idle in the background it won't respond or load webpages I was previously on. \u0026 I've found that with my neopets account it's a 50/50 shot in the dark as to whether it will work or not and at first it did, like a dream. Now I can't get it to load anything besides in-site ads which is obviously not my goal! Fix please!!!
1237	5	a	It works.   I told the file manager to open with Stuntzurl every time then I told Stuntzurl to open (my browser, Firefox) every time.   Now all urls open straight from the file manager in Firefox without any other action.   Just what I wanted since no browsers want to import  Favourites any more.   Spiffing.
1238	1	a	It crashes everytime I tried to add any new information.  This would have been great if it actually worked. I need an app that tracks cal, fats, protein and carbs with a count down.  People don't  even waste your time on this.
1239	5	a	I love the fire it tells me a story on how many times I've been burned,but now i bring the flames.
1240	5	a	This why I don't want no one.
1241	5	a	Definitely a must for all travelers :)
1242	1	a	What's the point of trying this out if you can't save your work?
1243	5	a	Purpose of this app is very good. Daily darshan is awesome. Also bookings helped me a lot
1244	5	a	I really like this app. I have not had any problems with it either. I don't know or have any ideas on how to improve it at this time. Look not everyone is going to have the same results that I have been getting , but for me and what I'm looking for the app is OK.
1245	5	a	Not every day you see a game on mobile that explores an interesting new concept and also fully delivers on it. Visual style is great and the dificulty curve is challenging. There are some performance issues that may lead to cheap deaths on my device (galaxy note 3).
1246	5	a	It's good I saw this on instagram on some ones picture and thought to my self I should get it it's a great app recommend it to everyone
1247	1	a	Scorelorpe ad is so annoying I can't take it
1248	5	a	Favourites facility is very useful, especially if you get a discount on specific brands. The stations selling them might not be among the cheapest at full-price, but you can how they compare with the discount
1249	5	a	Pĺ make less Mb of csr
1250	3	a	" don't start playing it).  The gem problem is in all of these games.  Personally I feel teamlava \u0026 Storm8 does this on purpose.   Many players for years have complained about it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"""
1251	4	a	First mobile game to give me nausea. Other then that.  The bit that I can play before I am in dire need to stop seems fun.
1252	5	a	easy to access all the recipes.
1253	1	a	Would never open keeps force closing
1254	1	a	This is a child's game. I cannot believe how cheap this developer could be. Only three dresses available and popups asking to pay at every turn for more accessories. $3.99 for a virtual dress?? Are you kidding me? The whole thing isn't worth paying any more than 99 cents for. There's plenty more dress up and make up apps in the store so don't waste your time on this one. This developer should be ashamed of themselves. This is robbery, it's listed as a free app.
1255	1	a	Ide delete,nov dizajn je uzas,ovo je u najmanju ruku smesno..
1256	5	a	teaching kindergarten. i've been teaching kindergarten kids for over 10 years now. lately weve received a nice package of iPads so i've been looking for apps to help me teach the basic skills. this app is perfect. All of the kids love it and I find it very useful.
1257	5	a	It is really good because  you can just run around
1258	5	a	Lets us find out about it
1259	3	a	Végre a jegy vásárlás gyors, használható. Viszont az applikációnak vannak igazi pain-in-the-ass dolgai. 1. Ha a net kapcsolat lassú akkor a jegyek letöltése az előtérben blokkolja a jegy hozzáférését. A jegyeket lehetne a háttérben letölteni. 2. Offline módban, ha a valid és az expired tab között váltogatok, akkor nem változik semmi, csak akkor ha a next gombra is rányomok. 3. lehetne esetleg olyan funkció hogy a jegyet pdf ki lehessen menteni, hogy át lehessen küldeni másnak.
1260	5	a	Jabari Dum is actually spelled Dumb
1261	2	a	" it slows the process down of logging on.  I highly suggest the user name \""remember me\""  feature and put both the username and password sections on one page.  Make those changes and 5 star for sure."""
1262	5	a	Whao! A great app and works perfectly. It deserves 5 stars
1263	5	a	Good game I love it
1264	4	a	Question here, please answer/ provide a solution: When I try to use the product, the music lags, stutters like hell. I have a UMI eMax phone, which is otherwise pretty fast, scoring around 40.000 on Antutu. Has anyone experienced this before? Otherwise, the sound seems to be great.
1265	5	a	Gajab...mind fresing game :-P i love it
1266	5	a	What can I say? I've been using this for nearly a month and its really nice. High resolution; parallax effects; breathing effects; customizable colors and settings. Low battery consumption, I see no difference on my battery. Its really nice. If people are having problems, email the dev before leaving a bad review.
1267	4	a	Only 1 issue, I think the timer keeps cutting off the internet, mine is set to go online once an hr for four mins, also when the screen is unlocked. If I'm using the phone it disconnects once every hour and four mins, so it seems. It needs persistence setting.
1268	5	a	Best pictures of our Universe and easy to use.
1269	1	a	Im like since 2 hours trying to figure out why I cant hear my voice or anything while im recording. The app record the sound but dont let me hear while im singing. I paid for this app and the equipments. And I did get the sound guide on an iPhone(vocalive).. I aint getting it here w a Sony Z3. I will rate it with 6 stars if an answer appears. How am I supposed to sing if I cant hear my own voice. Im totally disappointed. Vocalive is sooo much better
1270	5	a	My 3 yr old special needs ASD and ADHD absolutely loves this and has kept his concentration and taught him very well !!! with lots of fun and giggles mixed in too 5 big shiny stars 😄😘😝😎
1271	1	a	It won't even let me play I can only pick a car.
1272	1	a	Screen goes to sleep and app quits SUCKS!!!
1273	4	a	It's very handy to have to listen to let you know when danger is could possibly be in your area the only thing is that they are a lot of the channels that you can't get. It helps us people like the ones with I watch neighborhoods.
1274	1	a	Its not even creepy nor scary. Its more like afew everyday things a crack head would do. The story's are short and dont keep my attention.
1275	1	a	THIS APP IS VERRY BAD plz dont vest time he app khup ghan ahe ye app bahut karab hai .......i hat this app lol
1276	5	a	If you can wobble back layer object and freeze front layer object. It will be perfect.
1277	4	a	it has potential to be great. just the graphics aren't all that great and i think you can come up with better controls. for example, make either the boat movement or selecting something double tap because when both are normal tap, it messes up. and make a tutorial. it was confusing for me at first
1278	4	a	hi SUD team; it's very nice but one thing is missing. the camera option of inner view is not real. Outside view from car(both sides) is not there. Include it.
1279	1	a	I log in and this app stop working. How this stupid apk can get 1 million downloaded
1280	2	a	التطبيق بطيئ جدا ويهنق على طول خصوصا وقت التنقل بين الفئات
1281	5	a	Great app can be used in different states. unlike like door dash .
1282	4	a	Gra dobra, lecz nie wiem po co jest jej informacja dotycząca stanu telefonicznego. Prosił bym o wyjaśnienie.
1283	5	a	I bought a lot of stuff but I deleted it and then downloaded it again but I \ncouldn't get back the stuff i bougt and I was a high level too I had a lot \nof stuff
1284	1	a	I can't log in, even after changing my password. The login attempt times out even after uninstalling and reinstalling. Real pain in the butt.
1285	4	a	Does what it needs to perfectly.needs one improvement though, when on a different call why does the blocked number/call show on waiting.needs some minor changes there.
1286	3	a	An absolutely 100% average RPG. Lasts about 20 hours, but non-boss battles take longer than they should. The Job Tablet system is nice, and less grindy than other Job systems in other games... but is still grindy.
1287	4	a	I play this game on a Toshiba Excite AT275 I have no complaints. Its one of best out there. The up dates are Great!!!
1288	5	a	Serious Review! Just Loved It!!!😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
1289	5	a	I honestly didn't expect much from this app. My experience was so different that I am now looking into what Hypnosis actually is. A amazing app. Definitely going to make this part of my every day routine. BTW this is the first app I have ever reviewed.
1290	5	a	It is awesome you have free mode with no cars
1291	5	a	I like this app because my daddy passed away when I was  11 r.i.p daddy and Lord take care of him 👼👼👼
1292	1	a	I open 10 times nothing happend so i deledte the game and try again but its not working what happen here
1293	3	a	Updated to 5.0 on my Nexus 7, stopped working. It's like the developers haven't had months to sort things out or something... Update: Works now
1294	4	a	Einzig die Nägel haben leider einen spiegelverkehrten Schatten.
1295	5	a	Using with Note 4 and Elite Sliver2 bluetooth. Makes calls with the phone locked. Not perfect tho, doesn't understand all the names that are spoken. It will do a lot more than make and receive calls.
1296	4	a	Was playing the game with the app connect and when Sam and Chris entered the cable car station in chapter 2, the screen switched to a  cam corder image of Sam and my phone 'app' rang with a message! Was pleasantly surprised by this app! 😀👍
1297	5	a	Thank you helped me many times. If I could I would give it 10 stars
1298	1	a	Is there any way to make it not stop? It cuts off after 10 minutes or so :(
1299	3	a	I need help its not working for my 4.4.4
1300	4	a	I love the game but whenever i do surveys or any quick action to get n-points (coins) I never receive them even after finishing the objective
1301	5	a	Super love this game !!!!!
1302	5	a	This app is really good it not only tells you about the plants used but also how to use them. If you're a beginner like me where natural remedies are concerned this app is just about the best thing you'll fine for free.  whoever the creators are you did a great job and deserve our respect for it Thanks
1303	5	a	I have had this app ever since i got my Droid bionic a little over a year ago now and i love it. Save for the fact that every phone update breaks it entirely. My phone updated itself to 4.1.2, and nothing works at all. Here's to hoping for a quick fix!
1304	5	a	Very pleasant sound. Relaxing not harsh at all.
1305	2	a	You are almost 10 years but you cannot implement any notification that the app is updated. And aside from that you makes as all waste time.. buti sana ang pag upgrade successful kahit hnd nag notify.. ok nlng sana un pero hindi.. palpak parinng app.. hnd mka login sa web app.. useless dn ang pag upgrade ano ni upgrade nyo..? ung numero ng version ng app..?
1306	2	a	Hatte mir ne Tanke rausgesucht, angäblich 1,116 super 95, als ich dort war waren es 1,15X, nochmal gecheckt, die app zeigt immer noch 1,116 an...
1307	5	a	it took 5 hours to download
1308	5	a	Hope you developers will continue adding functions, make it in a plus version and charge  at least $5 so you get the inspiration to continue!  I would like: Understandable filename Possibility to disable of return button A global bookmark view for all bookmarks or for all in a selected folder Possibility to add reminders or actions for a bookmark  Tip: for sharing a note, open it, select menu-send document
1309	4	a	عمل جميل ورائع ولكن مع ملاحظة مايلي: كثرة استخدام كلمات بين قوسين وهذا يفقدنا اﻷسترسال والخشوع وكأننا في درس بحوث وتشكيك المصادر! كما في جعاء كميل. وثانيا. ارجو اصافة ملفات صوتية ولو للشهير منه. . .  شكرا وبارك الله بجهدكم الرائع.
1310	3	a	Not a bad endless runner. Im not a fan of the graphics whatsoever, but its a decent challenge.
1311	1	a	Won't work anymore and doesn't allow me to update... not even an option even though updates are supposed to be available using Samsung galaxy s 2.
1312	3	a	I think this is a lot better than Abduction! I love all the different stages. However, I'm not too thrilled about how the only bonuses you can get are High Jump, Parachute, and Crumble. I also don't like how some of the platforms crumble even if you didn't get the Crumble bonus. I really wish the Extra Life bonus was in this game, because it was really useful to me in Abduction! Also, if you read my other review in Abduction!, the glitch is even worse in this game. Please fix \u0026 I will rate 5 stars~
1313	1	a	đã là bản cho smartphone thì nên có giao diện và chức năng tiện hơn, có thể share link qua msg...... share lên fb vs gg thì để làm gì, giờ thì ko có nữa luôn. và app chạy rất chậm, ko down load dc coupon..... bỏ ko xài nữa
1314	4	a	It's only been 9 days, but yeah it's O.K.
1315	5	a	Great, better than all snake variations. Good work!
1316	5	a	Awsome!! I have always loved to see pine tree branches weighted down with snow. This is beautiful, and being able to adjust size and speed is great!!
1317	3	a	Holds ur hand while u play not really much going on other than feeding and increasing ticket prices the first 20 mins
1318	1	a	I   kenat   undertand
1319	1	a	I hate it I'm reporting this and playing ROBLOX download this and you will be much more happier you get to explore the world but on this it got nothing but chatting and going places and some of it is locked and you have to buy that I just HATE this game it is so much better on a laptop or a computer
1320	2	a	How Do You Get The Sound Turned off? I unchecked the sound boxes, but it still plays a sound. Also I wish games would turn off the sounds to their advertisements.
1321	5	a	The pets are just so cute I could eat them up!no better game than this!the only thing is I wish you could choose what the pets look like without using jewels,gems,diamonds or whatever those thingies are from right off the start.
1322	3	a	Is a nice game for our mind but the answers we don't know and we don't have any more hints what should we do??? It says that if u don't know the answer the key will answer the question automatically.... But that never happens!!! Why?? Will someone make me understand please.…..
1323	5	a	2.3 Love how this calculates as you type. Also really like being able to view my answers as a fraction with a touch of a button. Great calculator!! 3.0.1 Prefer the old icon to the new one.. would like the black bar across the top to be collapsible via menu button on phone... maybe text color can change to blue instead of a painfully visible big blue bar under functions category.. Just a thought.
1324	1	a	Nothing like what it use to be. Earlier interface and unpredictability was its charm. Now its just another image overlapping app. Very bad update. Was expecting a new out of the box n quirky effect. This update is such a disappointment. Very rundown and uncool UI, the designer didn't get the app. Not creative at all, you lost your app, buddy!
1325	5	a	So funny I wanted to prank my dad my 3 three year old brother next to him and the call came my wet himself and fell off the couch and tried calling away so I do it again and he just freezes with terror it was awesome!!!
1326	5	a	This application is perfect. does exactly what it is supposed to do. very small. just makes the screen all white and no ads. to get out of it just hit the home button and contrary to how I feared it does not leave the application running . so simple but it took me a long time to find it the others try to do too much
1327	3	a	This app is quite good.  However if it gets some improvements, that would deserve 5 stars
1328	5	a	Simple and requires NO permissions. Exactly what I was looking for!
1329	1	a	Doesn't work evo need direction
1330	5	a	Thanks for  free google play for iran♥
1331	5	a	Cảm ơn tác giả. Nếu tích hợp thêm các tài liệu về Hoàng Sa, Trường Sa thì tốt quá :))
1332	1	a	Force closes on all my phones... Suddenly blocks apps that should be \nallowed internet access.. And when you try to enter the app, the phone \nstops reacting.. Only way to fix it, is to restart phone. Going to look for \nanother one...
1333	2	a	Works ok on X10MP, but not keen on the interface. Adware
1334	1	a	Junk freezes cheesy play a loser game uninstalling
1335	4	a	Some features like the blur and saving resolution could be improved but other than that it's great!
1336	2	a	if it would convert the media type to whatever format it uses would make this app so much more useful.. Only seems to work in camera mode
1337	1	a	Wont load! It's crap mabey try a simple game like x's n o's that might be better since ur beginers at this...
1338	5	a	Even worked for modded minecraft
1339	1	a	Fuld af fejl. Amatøragtigt lavet. Bruger den kun fordi der ikke findes noget alternativ
1340	4	a	Cool...but... Can you please make it free to upgrade? I really encourage people to play this game...but... TWO DOLLARS FOR A UPGRADE!!!!! Sorry, bit that's insane I will rate 5 stars if it is free. And viewers... Check out my other reviews, they are accurate and true.
1341	4	a	Now not working... pls update
1342	1	a	horrible game. u cant even control the bike.. DO NOT DOWNLOAD
1343	5	a	Where can I get the calendar widget of this theme?
1344	5	a	Placut, mai ales cand il joci in mai multi
1345	1	a	You don't even do anything
1346	5	a	Loved the game  The hints could have been more elaborate though
1347	3	a	Good game. Not great, but what killed my interest was the 30+ second ads that you have to watch after every level. This is the first app to make me get an ad blocker because it was just too much of the same dragon whatever game ad every minute of gameplay. Unfortunately this game has potential but $5 for ad free? Really guys? All the other aps that are free or 1.29 to unlock ads? That wasn't enough for you. Disappointed in that, at least the levels are fun when you're actually playing
1348	4	a	Thanks for the use of the most popular programs for Android
1349	5	a	Muy facil de usar y redivertido.
1350	4	a	I am a beautiful person who is not responsible
1351	3	a	It's OK....not big wins at all...I'll play for a little while longer. I just started...but taking my coins very fast.
1352	4	a	Not sure what's up with some of the one star reviews I haven't had a problem with what this app offers.  - Regardless I was hoping to be able to manage my products and promote on my phone.
1353	1	a	my screen turned black the minute I put the game in. almost broke my phone. your game should be zero
1354	5	a	TRUST me it's a good game and it's music is awesome Man
1355	1	a	Not opening in LG-G2 Mini
1356	1	a	It should not be in lndscape mode. This way you can never play it and most of the eggs will never hit the bucket. As suddenly eggs collide with grass.
1357	5	a	اولش عالیه ولی آدم میخواهد بقیه مدل های را هم دانلود کنه
1358	4	a	I want 2 know y  half the time that I try 2 go in2 the game sometimes it won't let me \u0026 also y does it kick me out of the game 4 no reason @ all? I'll just start playing it \u0026 it will kick me rite out. I would rate 5*s if it wasn't 4 that
1359	1	a	Doesn't have my model Samsung bluray htfm53
1360	1	a	Doesn't work at all! Still force closed after clear multitask. There's no setting for multitask in my phone. Has this stupid app but still no privacy at all
1361	3	a	Useless to me sans that, but I appreciate the developer's response. Thank you.
1362	5	a	I use this app all the time and I love it!
1363	5	a	Im from Singapore and i fuxking love the music!!!  The best app so far.  Thumbs up.  The only problem im facing are the language written in the app itself. It would be great if there is English option to choose from.  Other than that,  ure the best. 101% using your app daily. Xoxoxo.
1364	1	a	Waiting now almost a hour for a taxi. This app is useless
1365	3	a	The too close proximity beep sound is too irritating, there should be an option to turn it of or lessen it's volume. And when in motion the brake doesn't work at times.
1366	5	a	This app is awesome however you can do something about keypad like increase \nthe size of buttons that would really help as there is no such keypad \navailable on play store
1367	5	a	This is a good game i liked it very much
1368	2	a	"Good for keeping track of your balance. That's all I really wanted it for. An easy way to check my balance without the hassle of logging into the website. It is excellent for that. The app is otherwise completely useless. I could not get it to make a call with my Callcentric account. It just says \call failed\""."""
1369	1	a	The app has just one on-off field. There is no way to know whether or not it is doing its job.
1370	3	a	بتمنى انكم تعيدو تطوير البرنامج ليكون اسهل للاستخدام ....واخف
1371	1	a	I have installed this theme before. It was really cute especially the elephant trunk. When u touch its moving \u0026 throwing out water. And it got bird u can place around ur screen. Now when i installed it on my other phone it doesnt show any moving effect. even the bird doesnt move anymore. Is it my phone problem or i just miss all the updates? im going crazy trying to findout where \u0026 what i hv to do to get it like the old days. Im a bit disapointed if everythings really change.
1372	5	a	" diverse personalities... Just great overall. Good job; it wasn't as stupid as other visual novels which make the character change at an unreasonable rate."""
1373	1	a	Your baby fish die after 5 minutes and you can't do anything about it. Also magic fish doesn't last long. No buying full version as the reviews look bad. Very disappointed

1376	5	a	So this is a great great  wonderful game. SUGGESTION 1.when a lion partner gets knock out he gets sent to the den not out 4 mins. Thats it thats how good this app is 😄😃😚😗😀😙😊😜😝😝😛😘😌😅😋😏 Edit: Please make the females pregnant though and also make her have to nurse when the baby is born Thats all bye like i said before nice game! Keep them coming! (this is a edit)
1377	2	a	Wasnt able to find the camera on my galaxy s2
1378	3	a	Frequently marks you wrong for correct answers.
1379	5	a	I've been so disappointed when Google maps will that me the wrong time the bus will be somewhere and ruins everything! This app, for the most part, I'd absolutely fantastic! It has it moments when it can't find a bus for some reason but when it does it's very accurate
1380	4	a	Very good game but very laggy. And am starting to notice a very glitchy problem with unity games on my device zte blade 3 there seems to be like a ghost mirror trailing effect on some of the objects
1381	1	a	Can you please address some of the questions regarding word predict from reviews I get the feeling that there is no word predict or a good dictionary. People say that it doesn't do even simple words like I'm or I'll or she's etc. Is this an issue in the paid version?  Would like ti know before I purchase. Thanks!
1382	5	a	Good game starts out easy but gets challenging pretty quick
1383	5	a	Get this game, pet lovers! The only word I have for it is... AWESOME!
1384	4	a	... It losses some of it's effect because there are app icons that are not supported.. Yet (I hope)!! I hope the request feature comes back soon... Good job guys! I also like the two dark wallpapers but not the light ones...
1385	4	a	There is always room for more improvement
1386	4	a	The app is amazing n helpful too but for god sake stop those irritating ads every few seconds or a minute if you can!!!
1387	4	a	Nice game. It's really fun and a good time killer
1388	3	a	I had purchased Notify pro because I like notify lite but I wanted Gmail notifications but had to uninstall pro  because Gmail notifications wouldn't work on my S3.
1389	2	a	Cute snow globes. I had to delete because the drain on my battery was too heavy.
1390	5	a	Great apps! It helps a lot!
1391	4	a	Amazing..absolutely amazing. ^_^, I would like to see lions be able to take over prides like they do in real life. Defeat the head lion. I would also like to see more than one lion be born so you can actually teach then hunting skills and it developes. Also, it'd be really cool if there'd be scavengers trying to take your food away like the hyenas. Lions should only come in if they are desperately needed. They should remain a good distance and protect the Cubs and defend their dens from other threats.
1392	1	a	I super hated it ...... Has many ads ads ads then it stops and logs....... And!!!! It doesnt save the level of the games......
1393	3	a	Decent concept, uninspired graphics, fumbley controls and story
1394	5	a	Ok  For free call n txt n wifi
1395	1	a	It does not not work with Moto X. I've tried 2 different devices with latest Android version.
1396	1	a	Doesn't even have an icon for the phone. WTH?
1397	1	a	I cannot get the Android to talk under Custom Suggestions. Please help. I have a Cricket phone.
1398	1	a	"This app used to be fantastic. But it's been \updating\"" for nearly a year now and completely sucks. The pictures on the Google play store lie about what the app looks like now. This app needs to get their shite together and bring back the old app or at least give people a timeline as to when it will be back"""
1399	4	a	Har engelsk OS, men ved hjælp af TTS fået dansk vejledning...
1400	1	a	Since update no files will open, I only get the Check internet connection error with full WiFi and full signal. Please fix as I can't access my.companys documents on the go anymore! Xperia SP
1401	5	a	After just a quick action on the computer, this app works like magic! The only problem I'm having is that the overlay button doesn't disappear for a long time after the app is stopped.
1402	1	a	I have been scarring 1 person for 4 hours! Every time I scare them to the exit they don't run out of the area they run back to the part that I originally scared them at! I WANT A REFUND
1403	1	a	I didn't see anything explaining what anything does. The upgrading seems to take about 5 minutes longer than i was willing to play. Lost interest really fast.
1404	5	a	Has wonderful screenshot editing options...You guys should try having a few font options for the text as well :-) tells you which buttons to push for taking a screenshot I always thought mine was volume and power . It's actually power and volume down. Was good thing to find out.
1405	4	a	I forgot my preferences password how can I retrieve it, please help
1406	2	a	Și totuși pentru ce trebuie și read phone state?
1407	2	a	Advertisement pop up during gameplay that is very annoying advertisement should be displayed before the game starts and when you die not while you're concentrating on something else.
1408	2	a	It force closes + lagging too much!! \u003e_\u003c; (Xperia 10- 2.1)
1409	5	a	Lots of fun no problems you can't go wrong  getting  this game. I have one question what is that purple bar that fills up during battle what is its purpose.
1410	2	a	It doesn't even have or say what you have to do next. Do you exit out,  or just leave it like that? Who knows now because it doesn't say, please fix. Thank you.
1411	5	a	I thought this was going to be little kid game, but it's much more interesting than I expected. It's easy to make money and you don't have to ask friends on Facebook to help you do anything. I couldn't figure out how to transfer the game I started on my old tablet to this new one, but it's so much fun I don't mind starting over ;  )
1412	1	a	The ads pop up every now and then is highly annoying. Uninstalled right away. If you dont want to make it a free app, then don't.
1413	1	a	this app is so suckey whenever I try to play it won't work
1414	1	a	After the last update the application is not working it's not even playing the songs radio everything is shut down keep giving error messages
1415	5	a	Slush invaders on the computer I past it the the last boss I think his name is big bio  prime something like that. And I also subscribed to your channel fielded guy or something

1420	5	a	Helloo hamza you can download snow bross very good game  BY
1421	5	a	Guys, thanks a lot for the app. Overall very useful.  One drawback I noticed. After I have read a notification on my SW2, the notification is still shown on the phone. While I'd prefer it to be cleared (read, hidden) on the phone. One must have tweaking : Default app setting must be set to ignore. Otherwise there are tons of notifications. Then choose only those apps that you'd like. Please add this to the manual shown at the first launch. Thanks.
1422	1	a	Previously has not recognised the hotel I'm in when I'm sat it the lobby (Novotel Canary Wharf) now it won't even go beyond the Facebook button on opening page, so am unable to check in. Have cleared catch, uninstalled and reinstalled....basically useless
1423	5	a	I love it !!!!!! Simple intence addictive great job guys
1424	1	a	It is the worst app I've seen so far
1425	4	a	This app is wonderful and does exactly what it is meant to do, but there are a few bugs. When you rotate the screen in 3x4 mode, the apps are reordered and everything is in a different place on screen. This can be confusing to a senior. Swiping between screens often stops working entirely, and it skips screens when in loop mode. I have three screens, but swiping in either direction from the second screen goes back to the first. Finally, when you change icons, sometimes they revert back to the default.

1438	5	a	Level 32 - Imagine breakout whilst being attacked by space invaders... And you get weapons.  So many levels, so imaginative.  Brilliant retro!
1439	1	a	It used to work on my s6. Now on my s8 it won't even start.
1440	4	a	This game does help you get ready for the real thing and it helps you understand how you hit the ball from different angles. 👍
1441	1	a	Good for about 5 words....sorry but I'm out.
1442	3	a	It looks like a baby game

1444	5	a	Excelente para fixação das letras pelas crianãs de 2 a 4 anos de maneira divertida!
1445	1	a	No buttons were showing any text. Bit hard to use because of it.
1446	5	a	Wish it were a bit larger playing board and that you didn't have to pay for everything like different backgrounds, dice, etc., (aren't the ads enough revenue for you?).
1447	1	a	Everytime i try to add a clip it stops working. This is only been going on since i paid for it. Anyone know how to get my money back?
1448	3	a	The issue here is the ads
1449	2	a	לא עובד עבור קווי מטרופולין השרון
1450	3	a	Fun game, but the glitch when it auto serves customers the wrong thing should be fixed. Didnt like that I lost all levels when i paid for the upgrade either. Other than that, nice!
1451	2	a	The font size is so small that I ll need a magnifying glass. Forget working the touchscreen. The developer has botched up the app fonts rendering it impossible to use. Read some comments below but they offer an alternative solution. Need to sort this out ASAP
1452	1	a	Whenever I press new game it exits. Pls. fix I want to play it...
1453	2	a	I used to love this app on my previous phone but it doesn't even start up on S5.
1454	5	a	Good app to learn and refresh
1455	5	a	I loved it. Me and my brother pretended that we were Chefs. But i wish everything was unlocked. But everything exept that were fun
1456	5	a	I have a kindle fire and I use to have this app. And I loved the app..  But because I have a kindle i can't download this app to my kindle and if there is a way please let me know...and because it's an Amazon I'd have to get Amazon stuff they don't have cool apps like google play..
1457	5	a	Lol I just wanted to see if the rate went up
1458	3	a	It's okay, but not sure if I can trust it because I know some of the facts are wrong.
1459	1	a	no update, no new server, no event, no facebook, no forum, no news, close soon.
1460	5	a	It has a bunch of difficulty levels and the highest difficulty had the hardest Sudoku puzzle I have ever found.   It also has an extensive tutorial on perhaps every known technique on solving sudokus.    I also like that it has a stats system that keeps track of how fast you're solving puzzles at each difficulty level and compares your times with the rest of the world.
1461	1	a	Very bad ..do not download it
1462	1	a	Been playing for 3 days and never once got onto the game board ? Boost never holds either rather defeats the point of having a feature board if you cant get onto it
1463	4	a	A nice app for engaging kids
1464	5	a	This game is just what a mobile game should be. Easy and fun to play without asking for anything in return. I hate it when games want to know my location and other things that don't relate to the game in any way. Add to that, this game has great animations, good music, and the kind of gameplay that can keep you entertained. Awesome in my book. Turn those turtles over!
1465	5	a	My cousin lost her cat and played the siunds for her neighbor who is 6.
1466	2	a	Why cant i ever play online you must fix this because apparetly the samsung phone version wont let me play online.  My brother can because he has a iphone a peice of junk iphone works online over my quality Samsung phone. FFFIIIX IIIITTTTTT!!!!!!
1467	5	a	It really works for me...
1468	1	a	Atrocious game don't waste your time with this
1469	5	a	Best developer ever. The games are so simple and kinda dumb, but they're so weird and creative that I can't stop playing. Thank you!
1470	2	a	Should all be in one app, not a separate one
1471	2	a	Add the ability to just put it onto lock screen only please

1474	5	a	Its all I need without autobrightness
1475	5	a	I downloaded this app for my daughter just before she was one an she loved it. Every easy to use an taught her a lot.
1476	4	a	wow, you guys! lightweight, sufficient info widget, no ads, it's good, period! wish more app developers create such light weight and no-hog apps..
1477	1	a	When I tried to use my own picture it never let me all it does is use its owm.no one should download this app it is boring
1478	1	a	Scary terms and conditions. No privacy at all. They can do whatever they \nwant with your data. Do no install.
1479	5	a	This programme musculation app is very useful for me...thankks
1480	4	a	Insanely hard. The logic behind the movement doesn't connect with my brain. Also why the permissions? I'll not be getting a refund even though it's the same thing over and over but still addictive and chaotic like... Yep you guessed it... Super hexagon. I like the variations on it though. Still dunno what to do but wooo
1481	5	a	This is a hidden gem in all the browser apps out there. Best browser in all aspect - UI, speed, fluidity and memory usage. The adblock success rate is among the best I've experienced. I've immediately deleted all other browsers and this one going to be my daily driver. Kudos to the dev👍
1482	5	a	I can with an A in both turn to the left and turn to the right with this app with no Bob Bob Bob left over and that's really a good use of my Nene
1483	4	a	Bt the language plz hlp
1484	4	a	It won't let me log in, but the game is fun and looks good.
1485	2	a	Looks blue instead of purple.
1486	1	a	I had install this game but its doesn't work properly....plz don't install!!!
1487	1	a	No selection of anything unless you pay real money... even then, I think it would still be a stupid app.
1488	5	a	This is a great and really fun game. However, lots of people really want you guys to add multiplayer. Real time multiplayer with different maps chat voice chat and different sniping game modes. Trust me add that kind of multiplayer plus more campaign will make you guys have a huge profit! Thanks and please consider this request and everyone else's.
1489	3	a	I can not send friends gifts it glitches every time and it knocks me off the game
1490	3	a	When I was playing an add poped up WHILE PLAYING not when you lose
1491	5	a	The amount of rewards you get is out of this world and highly recommended. Initial game will be difficult. Once you upgrade your arty, you will start kickin' ass. I was about to give a 1 star rating because it was too difficult in the beginning. Then i got rewards!! It was payback time. Awesome guyz
1492	1	a	Please how do I uninsatal.
1493	4	a	Its a nice game I like it it has shurikens that I like thanks for making this game even if there is one slight problem It Freeze's sometimes  so fix that for five stars !!!!
1494	1	a	I don't want people to play  I liked the picture of  meat that is better than the game
1495	4	a	Ya lumayan membantu sy dlm bekerja thx u very much...
1496	1	a	I really only installed this as a quest per my other Team Lava games, but its not worth it...more often than not after taking my (fake, thank God) money, it says machine is out of order, you lose your turn and the money.  If you must spend your real money on a game, beware of this one!
1497	5	a	Addicted...I have to find something else like this.
1498	1	a	Worest app hard to understand -:)
1499	5	a	Pity it does not show the key of the chords

1501	5	a	This game got almost everything awesome gameplay cool cars is like a Micheal Bay style kind of game with super cool explosions and please add a co-op lan mode so that me and my friends could enjoy the explosions together
1502	4	a	For a quick, free download, it is definitely worth it. Nice app to kill a few minutes with a group of people.

VERY KOOL!!!😎 VERY ENJOYABLE!! 😉
1512	5	a	A very simple app which works thanks
1513	2	a	I can not start to sing because they required to click on advertisement but there are no advertisements for me to click so it is really annoying and i do not know what to do
1514	1	a	Just spent 45 minutes inputting a list of 100 things and when I scrolled up to view the previous 99 it glitched and repeated the last two things I typed out and I hit the save button but it saved how I was seeing the glitch with the last two items repeated. Everything else had been saved over and was gone! 45 minutes retyping the list for the 3rd time!!! I couldn't even see the bottom item I was typing the whole time unless I put seven empty list items below where I was typing. FAIL!
1515	5	a	Awsome my baby loves it she is learning

1519	4	a	Very interesting and Joyful game full of nice and beautiful graphics. I want to play this kind of game from my child hood its not only about playing its about learning some skills also.I really want to give 5 stars as my elder kid also asked me to do this but due a number of sudden adds it deserves 4 stars.But good work need some little improvement in balancing the speed of balls in a stage after 5.
1520	4	a	An app for people who like to be challenged by games !
1521	2	a	I have seen this app running on iPhone looks really good.  But android app is not working on Samsung G S3.. It's crashes on load every time.

1531	2	a	Does not connect me to Facebook.. Uninstalling
1532	1	a	This app is a total waste of time. You can't make an account, so you can't fully play any of their games. Get your stuff together hive. Come on. Either fix it or remove it. Don't leave a broken product on the market!
1533	5	a	The app is OK but the only problem that the app can't understand most of the things. But it's quite fun playing it around
1534	5	a	I'm very excited! Well, I would like to pay for you guys. How can I do for???
1535	5	a	I love Spurgeon's writing!! Thank you Mr Whitney
1536	5	a	I love this app I also use it every day, as an electrician it helps in running conduit offsets, kicks  ... the power of the triangle aplied to real life. I wish there was a way of getting rid of ads tho. $

1540	5	a	Bueno, pero le falta pronunciacion figurada entre patentesis, faltan los verbos con pasado participio.
1541	5	a	Love,this app when christmas is almost here i use it...!
1542	4	a	Gagawin naming 5 toh pag inupdate nyu pa! nbasa ku na lahat ng paulet ulet eh. Para akong baliw pag magisang tumatawa. Naaalala ko kase ung mga Jokes ditu na nbasa ko.. Nice Work. JOKE.
1543	1	a	Ne znam da li aplikacija ne radi zato što Apex hoće da dere ljude nerealnom cenom USSD koda ili da bi se prikrilo katastrofalno stanje u gradskom prevozu...sve u svemu, do sada jedna od najgorih stvari koju su građani Beograda platili
1544	5	a	The best of all # 1
1545	1	a	Not realistic. I've played this in casinos many times and the dealer never has this many good hands.
1546	3	a	Am not saying good because am still downoading
1547	3	a	Has to improve their time given to lit crackers one after another..
1548	2	a	Information from the app is very outdated
1549	5	a	I love it for my kid
1550	1	a	My LG G5 has two main cameras - one for normal photography and the other for special zoom out - this one's uses the zoom out camera making the app useless...
1551	4	a	This app is extreamly addicting and i can't set it down. There is only one problem, and that is, every now and then, the game exits itself out during the middle of a run. Still an amazing game though!
1552	5	a	It brings back memorirs of the old classic games no LAGG 😄
1553	4	a	Great app easy to use but the only downfall that I see with it is just wish it was just a little bit brighter but anyways the way the colors fade in and out awesome
1554	3	a	Linkurile către articole de la descoperă.ro nu funcționează. Aplicație \nsăracă în design.
1555	5	a	Strange ideas for missions, makes killing animals that aren't really what this owl would typically consider prey. Also the controls are a bit difficult at the start, otherwise it's pretty cool
1556	5	a	This app use of studunts of MH
1557	3	a	the concept really SHAKES(ROCKS ✊)!!                          S, except for 1-2 reasons_ in the adv. feature the horizontal option never works or shows only again the one opted in the simple feature. And in the vertical option, it shows the thing to be worked out. But immediately corrects itself by portraying as error: responding to shake failed! Please fix.
1558	4	a	The game was awesome but I had one problem once I finish the game it wouldn't let me go on to the other stages it just kept popping up to the login for the server
1559	2	a	Crashes all the time never get goal alerts
1560	1	a	Bad game, its unrealistic, the worst graphics i have seen on any 3D tank game ever and its way too easy. II                                                                                          ~ Needs - 5 stars     and it says Sheridan tank its a Sherman tank with  17 pounder gun or a 76 mm
1561	4	a	Очень не хватает одной настройки - блокировки автоотключения экрана, как в броузере Dolphin.  Добавите ?  ;)
1562	5	a	Mau ni akung gipangita!!!! Paksit!!!!
1563	5	a	I love this very much because my idol - DongWoon is here ~^^~
1564	1	a	Not the best game ever. Confusing I guess.
1565	4	a	No need to add 5 t all my numbers
1566	5	a	You know when someone turns the tv or sound system volume to the level that just hurts your ears, open the app turn it down even if they've hidden the remote. Or just quiet enough that you can't hear the words but know they are making sounds.. turn it up. Want to jam while you are cooking? Turn it on set the tunes and blast it!
1567	4	a	Controls - controlling w/ the ship directly under the finger tip is annoying. Should be able to control the ship from anywhere on the screen.
1568	1	a	So bad bad bad I hate this😤😤😬😬
1569	1	a	I have the Food Train app \u0026 I liked it so I decided to try out the others like them. They ALL didn't work, error always pops up at the end. Please fix ! It must be so great!
1570	1	a	When apply it through  grpet jar white screen appear plz resolve
1571	5	a	Albanian language please! I can help!!!!
1572	1	a	There's no directions and you don't know how to aim
1573	1	a	The  older version was heaps better..everyone in picture was lit up..now its only the person in the glass that is clear n lit up.
1574	5	a	I love this game it is so good I play it everyday with my friends
1575	5	a	This game is so fun yay guess that's just let me show you
1576	5	a	It's a great app but since I start to use my new nexus 5x its force close pls fix it
1577	3	a	The colors \u0026 contrast are great! But the added 2011 graphics are distracting... especially in 2012. :(
1578	5	a	Now people its the best my favorite game to play.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1579	5	a	Simple and quick. Works great! Thanks :-)
1580	5	a	WOW! BAIE BAIE BAIE BAIE BAIE MOOI! !!!!!!!!!
1581	5	a	I use this to read articles from my RSS app (Feedly). I can save articles for later, and open several without leaving the other app. Surprisingly handy. I wish more sites could be saved offline - I assume this is a technical issue vs the site scripting/formattibg?
1582	5	a	It is solo fight...its is realy solo it just a sound lol
1583	1	a	if it show downloading english(us) then switch of your phone this is the solution.. okk
1584	5	a	جميل ولمزيد من التقدم فى الصور والفيديوهات والتجديد 👍👍
1585	5	a	Thanks for the app... god bless u
1586	5	a	NEED MORE LOVE CARDS...BUT I LIKE THE APP..
1587	4	a	Intro is interesting but there's a paywall
1588	1	a	THIS IS THE WORST CASE OF A CREATOR LYING ABOUT THEIR APP.
1589	1	a	Horrible... And TOO MUCH ADDS.  Want 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟,  than try harder.
1590	1	a	Dirt! Pretty sure this was never even tested. Tried the ios version and the \nandroid version, both do not work. Greyhound should remove the links to the \napps on their site and consider a new Dev.
1591	5	a	Awesome keep it up GREAT JOB!!
1592	3	a	It  sucks don't try to get this sucks
1593	5	a	Nice game .. Not Boring
1594	1	a	It is a lie it does not come out of the screen
1595	3	a	Helt ålreit app, men greier ikke helt å se vitsen med den når jeg like greit kan sjekke nettsidene. Om jeg kunne ha bestemt selv hva slags saker som kom opp på forsida kunne det vært et poeng for meg , å ha kategoriene jeg er interessert i samlet på ei egen side er ikke det samme.  Liker at jeg kan få notifications om nyheter, men i det siste har de begynt å komme med et utrolig irriterende lydvarsel. Siden jeg ikke får slått av denne lyden enkelt og greit blir løsningen å avinstallere hele appen.
1596	2	a	Funcionava perfeitamente até ter recebido o upgrade oficial 2.3. Agora nem sequer consigo fazer o logo in, fc imediatamente. Desire HD com Android 2.3
1597	5	a	Just an awesome app it is
1598	1	a	Doesn't even work. No flash or anything. Garbage.
1599	5	a	Thank you soo much, this game works flawlessly now great job!!
1600	5	a	SaiRam Said Shy am Said Bhagvaan
1601	5	a	Can type accurately than google translate but slower. But I like it. Yet Some words can't be typed. Eg സെറ്റപ്. Ippa ie combination of pa and pa was not possible
1602	5	a	Only just started on this app and seems really cool.
1603	2	a	The service request is marked as resolved without doing any work.
1604	5	a	Great app and used a whole lot. Thanks!!
1605	1	a	Didn't download I though  it was going to be great if worked I would at least give it 3stars so lame.if  I liked the game I would give it 5or4stars.
1606	5	a	The first game I've played with such gud graphics Nd sooo scary.I'm sure you're neva going to finish this 1 mission
1607	5	a	But very good resource, I need this because I'm a roofing contractor.
1608	3	a	It's fun to play but limited
1609	5	a	Because of that I can read my  HOLY BIBLE
1610	5	a	Does the trick for quick snapshot update
1611	1	a	Only shows one directory, which happens to be empty. Doesn't allow to edit Album Artist, and other areas.
1612	5	a	I like the app..it's easy to use and informative. The only issue is that the app doesn't open as often as i wish it would. Please fix this. Thanks!
1613	4	a	Nice... Would definately reccommend it for fans of crime games.
1614	5	a	Santapan Luarbiasa Buat Rohani Umat Kristen.Puji TUHAN...
1615	1	a	i think ads in apps are okay but in this app sometimes you have more ads than playtime... really frustating!
1616	3	a	need update for several snaps ... thank you
1617	3	a	Not enough room but cool
1618	5	a	" word for word stuff. Just fyi. Hope that helps the beginners. Blessed be!"""
1619	1	a	THIS APP WONT LET ME EXPORT MY MOVIE I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR MONTHS!!!! EVERY TIME I TRIED TO EDIT IT, IT PUT ME BACK TO THE HOME SCREEN AND IT LITERALLY SPAMMED ME WITH ADS!!! I HATE IT

1621	4	a	Its a great and awesome parallax live wallpaper. It will look mor 3dimentional if you add icon shadows. The depth will be more clear.
1622	1	a	" SMTT has stopped\"" and then shut down immediately. I'm using android version 4.4.2."""
1623	5	a	S0o0o0o Me rigHt now!! 😇😬😍😎👍👌👏   ○•°Yall are straight kicking BUTt on creating new themes that `us`     ○• UsErs•○   actually  offer. Or give recommended advice to!! \u0026 4 RHE m0st part I haven't had any horrible disturbed problems. Everything is simple as pie to use. Just Love it!!! THANK YOU\u0026 KEEP THE G00D Vibes coming!👍😯💜
1624	5	a	This is a unique keyboard and I like it a lot.
1625	4	a	I enjoy using this app.  Works great for jogging down memos or copy and paste articles or writing your own.   Only problem I have with it is there is no option to change the file save location to external card.  My galaxy s2 crashed on me and I lost everything.   So i won't be storing too much in this app until they give that option.  Will give five stars at that point as well.
1626	5	a	Very nice nd super app
1627	5	a	Thnx a lot this app dose the job  I hope this works on off screen
1628	1	a	Awful. Waste of my time. Do not download! I tried it and all that happened was the thingy moved strait to the corner and didn't move. Sucks. Good game if you want to waste your time.
1629	5	a	It's back!! :D :D :D
1630	5	a	Easy to use.  Includes great information in addition to the risk rating, such as station intensity table.
1631	5	a	BUT NOW...SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK!!!
1632	5	a	Many German words with searching and pronunciation. Easy to learn. Can be more helpful if combine with phrasesbook. Better than other German learning apps.
1633	5	a	It is so intersting game I love it very much
1634	4	a	I  love  lazy towñ
1635	5	a	Great app manages basically everything that has anything to do with your calls. Only complaint is that it doesn't start recording instantly. But other than that it's perfect.
1636	1	a	не работи на miui 7.  На miui 5  си работеше чудесно
1637	5	a	Great game. Im addicted to this cause of the bg music :)) well i wish the other bg music is free :))
1638	5	a	If you have purchased the FoxFi key from the play store, it will not work with this version. I was having the same problem with it not unlocking. I uninstalled this one, googled and found Version 4.19.7 which works with Adnroid 7.0 and above. It now works just like it used toon my s7 now on My Galaxy Note 9. Still a great app. FoxFi key app only works up to version 4.19 as far as I have seen. Hope this helps others. I have Sprint and it works great.
1639	3	a	Loved thus game but hate the updated version
1640	5	a	Play this everyday and it's great but when I  reach #69 on the dragon site, there is just no way to win so I Diablo app and reinstall. Please fix that and ad new mazes to game
1641	5	a	Awesome graphics easy to kill enemy's I love this game
1642	1	a	Ok wth!? It doesn't even work!?
1643	5	a	Great game, no silly cartoons.
1644	5	a	Ive played a couple games like this, like the bit star wars and regular bit hotel, and a couple more. But the layout, and graphics is great. The princess missions are cool, i love how you can see the characters sitting on the floor reading a book, or dancing or sleeping in their beds. Very easy to make coins the random boxes are a nice treat.  It would be nice if the elevator would go on its own like in similar hotel style games, also would be nice if there were more opportunities to make glu credits. Great
1645	5	a	By the looks of it this game is going o be a pain in the BUTT
1646	3	a	You can't make videos and it always comes back to the normal camera when \ntaking pictures. It's quite annoying and you really can't do much
1647	3	a	It needs a more modern look and needs a more advanced system such as having an ambulance see your location automatically, along with other stuff.
1648	4	a	Haven't used it yet but hope it helps else Ima be back to down rate it
1649	5	a	I connected this app to my 51a Plus I changed some settings and it works perfectly.  It's not the most useful app ever seen but it does work I am using a samsung tab e 7 inch tablet with 4.4 Kitkat operating system   if you look at other comments for this app you will see the radio settings you need to change there are just a few and it's very simple
1650	3	a	"HTC M9, can't stop capturing. Why is there no \stop\"" button within the app? There is no checkbox in the notification bar to stop."""
1651	2	a	Fui pegar um combo mega e não deixa proceder, seria apenas para escolher a bebida mas ele acusa que e faltam 2 itens a serem escolhidos, testando com outros combps também não aceita, apwnas alguns procedem a compra.
1652	1	a	When open the app its show problem in network try again...
1653	5	a	The best keno app.  Some of the payouts don't make sense.  For instance if you hit 8 out of 9 numbers, you win more than twice as much than you would if you hit 9 out of 10 numbers.  8 out of 9 pays out 60,000 (betting 10) but if you hit 9 out of 10, you only win  25,000.  This makes playing all 10 numbers pointless because the only way you can really benefit is if you hit all 10 numbers.  Also, if you hit 8/8 you win 150,000 but 9/9 only gets you 100,000. However, 9 numbers is the easiest to win on.
1654	1	a	¿Cual es la operación más usada? Poner los puntos en la tarjeta. Pues ni recuerda la contraseña ni es obvio donde están las tarjetas. No reemplaza la tarjeta física ni en broma. Absurdo.
1655	1	a	I have two boinc clients that I can connect to from my PC on the same network but Androboinc cannot connect to either of them.
1656	5	a	Fantastic for finding out about the best offers and discount.
1657	5	a	Saya semakin mudah memahami rumus mat
1658	5	a	It's my favorite song and I always play it and come on haters its what it said daaaaa!!!!
1659	4	a	Cool and then I download this game l was happy and my age is 9 and l was born in 2006 :-)
1660	3	a	If this ap had a steering wheel it would be much better like there other game parking 3d the graphics are great but controls leave room to be desired
1661	5	a	Osm app i like it
1662	5	a	I have been following the Leo King for a long while. I had an issue with my app order and a huge communication gap between app communication which caused a crisis in my banking, but they did resolve the issue. I will definitely support David Palmer in his endeavor to grow.
1663	1	a	This seemed like the perfect app for me.  Especially since you could add multiple horses to a ride.  But the app does not run correctly.  Any time I try to log a ride it quits.  I have been told it will be fixed, but they just keep telling me but not doing anything.
1664	5	a	Love these Winterlight live wallpaper apps...they're all so beautiful and don't drain my battery at all :)
1665	3	a	It's a cool app. I like that I can play my Amazon music simultaneously and play along. Problem I have is it doesn't recognize any of my midi keyboard controllers. This is a vital need, so for now, it's in the number to be purged from my phone.
1666	5	a	Its a nice wall paper
1667	1	a	Long video ads run every time I try to go back to the home page. Spent more time looking at the ads than at the app. Just for that I will intentionally not support the advertiser's products.
1668	1	a	It's an older version of aviary photo editor.
1669	1	a	and dont work soo hate it
1670	5	a	Isinya padat,bhsnya enak.Pokok e mantaaap
1671	3	a	I like the game but not the anagrams and how when you tap the screen it Does not move yet the don't tap so often come up
1672	1	a	I adjusted the settings to my liking no words were visible backwards forwards diagonally after that just a bunch of mumbo jumbo on the screen the one I did find wouldn't even let me mark the word as seen.. uninstalling and not ever recommending it to anyone
1673	5	a	It always gives me a little lift when I really need it. I'm glad I happened upon it.
1674	5	a	I Love This Theme It Is Beautiful \u0026 Creative \u0026 Unique . Thank You . I Love It .
1675	3	a	The crashes on expeditions happen frequently enough on expeditions to really hurt--and lower the rating-- since you lose some cool weapons (worse with steel being such a pain to get). Its still worth the expierience, so try it out. Don't you want to know what the hell is making those noises in the store room?
1676	5	a	It helped me to learn the states of the United States of America, thanks.
1677	1	a	This app dosen't even deserve one star, if the people who made this wanted MORE Stars then perhaps they should actually let us INTO the game.
1678	5	a	this game made for me dont play u
1679	3	a	The photo I am editing is too small, have hard time seeing the effects. Uninstalling.
1680	5	a	I love there beat its So COOL
1681	5	a	If this awesome game would be just a bit longer :) Once game mastered with all 3 difficulty levels completed with 'perfect' there's really not much to do anymore. Anyway it brought me a great fun while it lasted. Thanks for that.
1682	4	a	Best music player app for sure!
1683	5	a	Doesn't work anymore pleasee I love it but force closes
1684	1	a	This is a useless App
1685	4	a	Every time I open this app my contacts list closes.  I cant tell who is messaging me. It just numbers. I hv to keep rebooting my phone. The update has note worked on my Note 2
1686	4	a	This app covers the basics. The interface is not very good. Undo does not work properly, and zooming is clunky. Multi select would be very helpful as would a point editing that works better with touch devices.
1687	2	a	The backgrounds are nice but, there's an ad about every 30 seconds, and about 20 pictures to choose from. If 80% of those pictures were NOT scantily clad anime girls; I would consider keeping this app and giving it a higher rating. But until then...
1688	5	a	Best ringtone in thousands of others, maybe of all time, would love a flac supporting version!
1689	3	a	get rid of the ads I am in the middle of trying  to park and a stupid ad shows up and then I crash and it keep happening over and over again so I can't get past level 2 ! SO GET RID OF THE STUPID ADS AND I MIGHT CONSIDER 4 STUPID STARS !!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1690	2	a	Let's me play one round,  the advertisements make it semi lock up,  then on next round it crashes.  Fix and I will give higher rating
1691	1	a	On my SGS2 the image was too blurry to read anything, refocusing did not help, the zoom feature was slow as molasses, and then it crashed.
1692	2	a	مقارنة بالبرامج المشابهة.. يعتبر هذا البرنامج أحسنها.. و هو مفيد جداً للطلبة المبتعثين.. شكراً لكم.. تحديث: التطبيق لا يعمل بالصورة المطلوبة.. الأخبار لا يتم تحديثها لأغلب الصحف.. الصحيفتان اللتان تعملان بصورة ممتازة هما فقط الوطن و البلد.. أرجو إصلاح هذه المشكلة.. فالتطبيق كان الأفضل!
1693	4	a	I used it there it was good but a bit slow at times.
1694	5	a	برنامه ای فوق العاده که از میان 15پلیر مختلف که هیچکدام قادر به باز کردن تصویر یک فایل تصویری کم حجم نبودند اما mob player به خوبی توانست آن را باز کند . من از سازندگان mobplayerبسیار سپاسگزارم☆☆☆☆☆
1695	1	a	The Audionote payment portal is complex to use and froze a number of times while trying to buy. The transaction went through 3 times, and the developer has not responded to multiple email requests for repayment. Quite simply, fraudulent!!
1696	5	a	جزا الله خير علي من عمل البرنامج سهل البحث والنسخ اللهم صل علي محمد وآل محمد
1697	1	a	This app used to be great. Now all the features are only available on the \npro version. Not worth it when other apps offer them for free.
1698	3	a	Could use better background, and animation. But, good concept.  Perhaps maybe a try this position for a certain time would be a good addition
1699	4	a	Very useful for making quick calculatuons for modeling. The one thing that I wish it could do is copy the text from the box I want. Another wish would be some sort of history function to easily pull up recent calculations. Add these and it would be 5*
1700	5	a	Побільше б таких гарних іграшок українською!
1701	3	a	Good game but It's a bit hard.It would be better if it could give more hints.I'm lucky I have FIFA so I can check the teams!
1702	2	a	I want cartoon msg keypad , how i want this?
1703	3	a	Very easy to use.  A few changes are suggested.  Canada's postal code (US zip)has letters, so does the UK.  Make sure letters can be added.  And add a cell phone section pls!
1704	2	a	it has a good review but did not work on mine. 2 starts for now
1705	5	a	Thank you for such a beautiful wallpaper amazing
1706	5	a	Excellent :-)  Good game !
1707	1	a	It's more like a photo editor not a photo sketching app😔
1708	3	a	I would rate this game a solid 5 but it keeps Restarting after the 2nd round.I played up to the 2nd round like 6 times.Please Fix!
1709	1	a	This is the worst game in the world 😡😠😤
1710	3	a	This is a 4- or 5-star app if not for the fact that it wants too much personal info, as was stated in another review.  There are apps out there of similar quality that are much less intrusive.  Netgear, ease up on my privacy and I'll be back.  For now, I have to uninstall.  Have a blessd day!
1711	5	a	I love this camera starter 📷 but i have one thing problem this app, thats the timer because maybe the detector face cam its very hard for me for selfie because you need move to move it your body angle trick what the joke✌🌹👀 hoping to next update just please can you put the timer camera, i think its goanna perfect absolutley perfect camera app 💯 For me but at this time i really enjoy this camera starter c'mon its hooray for  selfieday 💯🙌 love it❤︎

1718	5	a	Great 2have as ur wallpaper. With the right type of music, some chilled out ambient or some other gentle psychadellic tunes its title definitely suits its purpose. TRY IT AND ENJOY UR TRIP!! ;-)
1719	4	a	This game is super amazing some people say that's not but it is super amazing. If you say it is  dum then I will hunt you down
1720	5	a	Keeping a record of your body fat percentile helps you with keeping an eye on your weight.

1722	5	a	Yet gets the job done.

1734	4	a	(´-ω-`) it took a sec to figure out but it works pretty well ! You don't even need the app it says its for!
1735	4	a	If you enjoy games like Tiny Tower this is great. And it has a lot of character. The animations, color palette, and little quotes your castle's residents say (sometimes they reference things like Princess Bride) all make this visually entertaining and charming. My only gripes are that the ads are the type that take up the whole screen and the game practically begs you to buy things. It's understandable since it's a freebie, but still annoying. But the game IS fun and adorable.
1736	5	a	I have one so much fun after this app
1737	5	a	really amazing so easy to use love it
1738	5	a	EXCELLENT JOB BY HUAWEI G700 U10 \u0026 RAM 2 \u0026 QUADCORE..I'M FIGHTING BY F18 SUPER HORNE EASILY BEST GRAPHIC.  THANK YOU.
1739	5	a	It's a fun game application. You will addictive to play it!!! I love this game.
1740	3	a	Too many freeze ups, too much to do with so little payment from the chores. Fix the problems would get higher praise otherwise game is so-so.
1741	1	a	That you for this app, its very helful to me. Again thank you...
1742	3	a	It's fun but it would be 5 star if it would take score or have courses
1743	1	a	I clicked on the game, the screen goes black for about 2 seconds and then comes back to the screen is was just on. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME
1744	1	a	Just moving stars and adds and adds and adds
1745	5	a	My 3 year old boy love it he learn and play at the same time
1746	2	a	Works well on S4 but crashes on start  up on the S6 Edge.
1747	2	a	Doesn't consistently work, which is too bad. I really like it when it does.
1748	5	a	بازیش عالی برای کسی که علاقه مند به والیبال هستند
1749	5	a	Gets you in the Christmas spirit. Love it!!
1750	5	a	I love it because i looks Sapporo  dilshes
1751	5	a	Pays out. Good. Could feel up screen and then click on bounces. I really. I'm not sure if this is not a good time
1752	3	a	Great game but it is really difficult to earn money
1753	1	a	Can't make it English don't downloed please fix I'm not Spanish
1754	5	a	Just starting hay diet and been researching and got lots of info and lists but this app just makes it so much easier and how long you need to digest each meal and what foods go with what. So much easier, a happy person 😊
1755	1	a	Update: notifications don't work and you can't set custom notification \ntone. Old review: Been using for few years now. Far better then network \nvoicemail. Only Downside is you cant hear your personal greeting so I can't \nremember what it was. Works for individual greetings you can play them but \nnot the main one.
1756	5	a	Perfect translations from English to Punjabi.No mistakes in grammar.
1757	2	a	Way to many adds and even the hard ones r easy
1758	1	a	Stupid and gross domestic product
1759	2	a	When trying to access through iphone it asked me alphabet and numeric password but then i access through android it ask only numeric password. How to solve this please tell me ASAP
1760	1	a	Accessing the menu option right after the game start cause a crush.
1761	1	a	Installed it on a Samsung Galaxy S4 after the first stage it Continuslly Crashes and re starts
1762	1	a	It crashes all the time with my Samsung Galaxy SIII. It will not stay open long enough to update my contacts. The old version worked great. Perhap InReach will work. The June 3rd has changed nothing.
1763	5	a	I like this game thank you!!!!!
1764	1	a	Nu merge neam! Se pare ca nici nu ii intereseaza review-urile negative.
1765	5	a	This is a point and click adventure that is awesome. I just could not put it down and am back in the app store for the next episode. You find objects and use them as usual but with a twist. This game has a camera and you can write notes on your pics. Zoom in, delete as you want. The puzzles were not too difficult. There is a hint button, which I was determined not to use to make the game last as long as poss. Can't see anyone being disappointed.
1766	4	a	I love this game as it is very fun. The sound was cute too. No ads.
1767	3	a	It's not so fun but it's definitely not boring
1768	5	a	I needed a colourful light to read by and this was perfect! No horrible ads popping up every couple seconds, just pure color of your choosing.
1769	4	a	I love the peak and this fabulous little app. However, the logo often stays in my notifications bar and the only way I'm able to get rid of it is by restarting my phone.
1770	3	a	I wish my credit card was linked to here and I wish the auto capture worked better.
1771	2	a	Dont like that you only get one scene
1772	1	a	You download it and I just says that adventure 2013 has stopped don't download it
1773	5	a	I Think This is a Really Fun Train Game
1774	1	a	It lowers the sound when you put up bass
1775	5	a	I enjoy playing Find the Difference games very much. I will keep downloading.
1776	5	a	I wanted to stick a couple of notes right on my Android home screen, so I'll see them repeatedly throughout the day. Lemo Memo does this perfectly. I chose it from among the many simple note apps because it requires zero special permissions. (For notes that I want to backup, I continue to use Google Keep.) I also like the choices of color and font size.
1777	3	a	Heh good when ur drunk
1778	5	a	Best parking game ever but need new cars
1779	5	a	It gives us what's on live in haram.                                                 May Allah reward the one who has taken the effort to build this app
1780	5	a	It is nice app .
1781	2	a	I played this at my old house and it gives me memories:D but also I can't even play the game now every single time an add pops up it annoying
1782	5	a	" I come for the savings the app provides. I save way more with the app than the prize could even be worth!"""
1783	1	a	Its so stupid i would give it a zero if i could
1784	3	a	Okay but not as good as City Billiards but at least is ad free
1785	1	a	Its not scary don't like it
1786	1	a	I try to insert the picture but I can't,also I want to make set of blank wallpaper,but it can't too,please tell me How to find it,I find it on the version before this version
1787	4	a	Muito bom o aplicativo. Como sugestão, seria interessante mostrar a estação mais próxima de acordo com sua localização atual.
1788	5	a	Good i like it.. so fun..
1789	3	a	It's a cool and a funny game the best thing is it does test your memory
1790	1	a	Appen vil ikke starte ordentligt, og man kan derfor ikke vise sit ungdomskort. Det er for ringe, og det skal rettes.
1791	2	a	The app only showed me the first picture I took. But before it worked
1792	1	a	Isn't this a waste of storage? Can't you just uninstall the apps manually?
1793	5	a	Can't find the 10th coin
1794	4	a	Works good on my old Moto 360.
1795	1	a	It is a worst game whenever I try to put an ingredient in the bowl it exists me out and shows unfortunately dumplings had stopped so requesting all those who had kept this game or going to download it pls delete it or don't download it only....😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😠
1796	2	a	Somewhat clunky interface, as well as buggy when saving each day. If it works, it can work well, but it's unreliable. We also had an issue with sharing charts, ours got overwritten by one shared with us. App does NOT work well with irregular cycles, and also does NOT allow you to manually adjust when the computer algorithms fail.
1797	1	a	Just dowloaded the game and cant even walk cuz of the first npc giving welcome. Rate 0.1
1798	1	a	This was the most boring game i have ever played
1799	1	a	One comment reported this in July. Your apps NEED bookmarks. Maybe one day I'll improve my rating.. if I ever get around to it.
1800	2	a	This game is pure rubbish. THE BAY RIDGE REVIEW KING OF BROOKLYN
1801	1	a	Ako nahrada citacky je to super aplikacia. Dost mi vadi nutnost zmeny hesla kazdych 100, co povazujem za vrcholne zbyticne. Akonahle sa zamyslim nad uzitocnostou tejto aplikacie, ked v telefone mozem pouzivat priamo pristup do banky, zastavuje sa mi rozum. Hlavne kombinaciou oboch aplikacii na jednom telefone sa nedostanete nikam. Prosim prestante pre kazdu aplikaciu pouzivat vlastne heslo a uspokojte sa iba s vyuzitim standartnehi pid a hesla.
1802	5	a	Be first at giving feedback ...you take so long to tell an applicant whether he/she has been granted a loan or rejected
1803	1	a	Waste of time only like five sounds that aren't funny don't downlaod
1804	1	a	This game realy sucks ! ! ! All i get is a black display. Do not downlod ! ! !
1805	2	a	Needs updating all the time takes me 10 minutes to open the game for my 3 year old son
1806	5	a	The game is fantastic and awesome
1807	5	a	I'm on 4.4.2, I've used this before on my last device with no problems. But for some reason it doesn't seem to work. I have it enabled, Xposed installer installed, everything's good but it just doesn't seem to enable. Any ideas for a resolution!?
1808	1	a	You get the car then it freezes I say dont get it waste of time and its 100% rubbish plz dont get it and if you say its good then forgive me while I last
1809	5	a	This Game is very interesting
1810	1	a	This is terrible. You give like eight really stupid filters, and that's it. No advanced editing of any kind. I thought we would be able to actually edit galaxies and stars into our pictures like you made it seem like we could do, but nope. It's just a couple of stupid lens glare looking filters. Waste of time.
1811	1	a	Paid for the full version but the game crashes at half of the tasks! Unable to move forward because I can't collect the needed items! Sent multiple feedback but no response! Don't waste your money!
1812	3	a	Just Dow an loading getting ready to set theme
1813	5	a	I really enjoy into this app
1814	2	a	"App works for checking balances.  But fingerprint registration only takes 1 fingerprint one time! So further verification greatly depends how cleanly was your finger recorded.  And with my CU 3 \wrong\"" fingerprints suspends the account."""
1815	1	a	ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!? I HAD TO WASTE 1 HOUR 1 WHOLE HOUR! THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE WORST LASER I HAVE GOT!   Did not EVEN WORK! MAKERS OF THIS YOU SHOULD BE VERY ASHAMED OF YOURSELF WELL DONE GOOD JOB YOU GUYS GOOD JOB 😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😬😬😬
1816	4	a	Great app. You can catch some pretty amazing shots , only wish it was flash \nactivated as well .. and able to record with the same picture graphics.. \nother than that it is awesome
1817	2	a	I wish whoever decided to eliminate the ability to store to the external micro SD card would reconsider. I once considered this a 5-star app, but now would give it a 2 or 3. I still like the functionality,  but not being able to store to the SD card is unacceptable. It's a pain and takes extra effort and time to first save to the device then transfer it to the SD card, then delete it from the device. I use the app a lot and and don't want to hog up my on board memory. Working to/from the cloud is not always an option. Please return the SD card option.
1818	1	a	S.low and boring. Something just doesn't seem right in how the bike rides. Feels like a lot of resistance when it should be rolling smoothly
1819	5	a	Buena app, recientemente actualizaron líneas del Mexibús y metrobus que \nfaltaban añadir, buena opción para poderte ubicar y saber para donde \nempezar recorrido
1820	5	a	It's difficult sometimes but funny when he gets mad and beats up his family (except his mom) spoiler
1821	1	a	Waste of time wont let you play as pop up cuts in before u can hit play even after viewing them.
1822	3	a	It's fun but really hard. I've played it for about 7 times a day and can never get it
1823	1	a	I am very disappointed this game is not good. The leopard should be able to drink water.
1824	5	a	it is very good it the best
1825	5	a	Mst app ,, Its help me on my bussines
1826	5	a	My theme phone is blue and it is interesting when in my phone...i give 6 stars
1827	1	a	The countdowns says 54 days until.?! But not what the countdown is for. It also makes you watch videos to use most functions
1828	3	a	The new update gives better graphics and more vehicles. Those are the only upsides. You must pay for most of the cars, less wheel spin, more traction, and glitchy home screen.
1829	2	a	It is free but to hard
1830	4	a	..not really any good only hear something onve every 15-20 mins
1831	5	a	Not much is free in USA. I'm glad this is.
1832	5	a	Great maker and very easy to use enjoyed
1833	1	a	ISpy is really a good piece of software, except one aspect: i need to register on a remote website to access my local webcams through an app or website. I know that the streams aren't actually streaming via the internet but i really dislike this idea.. i want to host my own website and store my own user\\password. I use VPN so i wouldnt need a subscription to access my local cams from 3g anyway. I'm unable to program a website for myself. Will donate once this is fixed. App unusable for me :(
1834	5	a	The ending depends on your choices and actions. Pretty neat game overall!
1835	5	a	One and all solution in one app for exercise
1836	4	a	Quick game but can be boring. Not much to it. Good to pass time!
1837	5	a	A wonderful  app .I enjoy it very much
1838	5	a	one of the best fighting game, i ever played..!! i used to play the little fighter 2.. beautiful game.. now they bring the masterpiece into different setting, the control is so fluid, the animation anf graphics are superb.. if you are fan of fighting game, you really should download this... i wish they add online multiplayer battle
1839	3	a	I'll often be playing then need to put the game down to do something else for awhile. I won't close the app, but when I come back 30 or so minutes later the game restarts itself and I lose a game that I wasn't done with yet. It's really fun but it's really sad that the game can't let me get to my true high score. I'm good at it so I can get up past the 16384 tile with room to spare but it takes forever. Maybe create a save game function?
1840	1	a	Too bad.. One of the safer less intrusive apps..
1841	1	a	NEVER opens anymore. Connection issue connection connection issue! That is all you get! Very rare to actually obtain the info you need! Shitful!
1842	4	a	You should make an update. After the phone guard jumpscare, it should turn off by itself so nobody will have access
1843	5	a	Great game on my Galaxy S III
1844	1	a	I am not able to access this application , neither it is displayed on the status bar. Kindly tell me the way how to use it . I am a non sony user. Using motorola g 2nd gen handset.
1845	1	a	Way to many ads, play for 30 secs and enjoyna ad
1846	5	a	great app and we can easily track the location of friends and also help ful for the girls safety and family can track the location of family members to sit at home.
1847	5	a	I like and its so fun
1848	5	a	This game is excelent Its a Perfect game if you like dinousurs And Im level 350
1849	4	a	Great design, great app; this is how a file manager should be.
1850	1	a	Need to improve more always shows unable to retrieve data please fix
1851	4	a	I've accidentally turned off my alarm too many times because I couldn't distinguish between the snooze and dismiss. I wear glasses as that small text that every alarm app has doesn't cut it. This is what I needed. Only reason I have it 4 stars is that you can't program different alarms. For example, I have always set alarms for weekday and weekend. Can't do that with this. Hope they add that.
1852	1	a	When you download an over 40mb app you don't expect a download for voice files!
1853	5	a	This game is fun for all ages. Very addicting. Download is a must. Only suggestion I could possibly make would to have checkpoints throughout the game so you don't have to start a level all over again. But that doesn't change my rating. Great work everyone. Keep it up!!!
1854	1	a	Tired of all the apps being installed that I don't use or want.  If this continues to happen I have no problem with going to another phone or service.
1855	4	a	Your 1 star is translate mister
1856	5	a	Its very good but i just feel a little change in it . Its very dull . Picture donot come clearly work on it other else its very good keep it up
1857	2	a	Disney Store Promo Playhouse Disney
1858	1	a	I have a Galaxy Note 4 running Lollipop says my device isn't supported. Please fix. I want to review it for my YouTube channel.
1859	5	a	Not too challenging.  It is somewhat short, but that's ok.  I wasn't able to get all of the bonus items.  Oh well.  Great game!
1860	1	a	The new version lost me many sub assignments. I kept calling the office thinking they had made the error. One of my campuses took me off their list because I complained about missing jobs! 😡 and the worst part is, I'm out the monthly charges for the sucky service!
1861	1	a	Most of the 5 stars are garbage, this app is terrible.  Shuffles are not realistic whatsoever.  The AI is terrible but somehow always wins.  Impossible to be president.  Also some of the rules are incorrect, so the gameplay is flawed.
1862	5	a	Cool \u0026 fun to play with. Would love to see more templates. O2X
1863	5	a	This drum machine/sampler is epic and awesome. It is very good for a drum machine and making drum patterns/drum(s) audio and is very good for music production. This is now my drum machine/drum(s) sampler for producing my music/music production.
1864	5	a	Понякога дава грешки, но иначе е страхотна игра и добре направена! Благодаря.
1865	5	a	If your YouTube DOS NOT work get thes app
1866	1	a	"Wow. You force caps. Delete your account now. You fail greatly. \There is an option to change that\"" ok that is incredible. An option needs TO BE SET not to cap each letter? What amazing ruotine sid you have to write for that.... (obviously i think that is prime stupidity.) Lololol you are very funny. Yes NO i dont. I uninstalled this fail. Dude i've program longer than you've lived."""
1867	5	a	"ALL YOU GUYS R SOOOOOOOO WRONG YOU ALWAYS SAY \TERRIBLE LAGS OR SMETHING\"" YOU GUYS R WRONG!!!!! It is so awesome"""
1868	4	a	This developer has the best escape games out there. Only one small complaint, some clues don't make sense, forcing you to watch the ads to watch the walk through. But that's ok with me, these escap games are so much fun. P.S. I would love to ask the developers about how some of there clues make sense. Anyway, I  really should give 5 stars.
1869	1	a	Everytime it does pop up it goes away as soon as I try to tap on it to watch the dragons come to
1870	1	a	This game is a waste of space it took forever to download and it doesn't even work. The home screen will pop up but when I hit the play button it doesn't do anything. It just sits there like a bump on a log
1871	2	a	Dobra je kada radi, ali evo sada ne radi vec jedno 6-7 dana. To je skroz neozbiljno. Ili treba da radi kako treba ili je ukloniti skroz.
1872	2	a	"Doesn't give me all the info I want...would like to see ledger balance along with available balance like before the \update\""."""
1873	5	a	Thank you for this great application.  Its so helpful
1874	5	a	The Best as You develop more awesome apps
1875	1	a	I cant even get it as far as to see the pictures Help
1876	2	a	The augmented reality is really too sloppy yet but the app is quite good...
1877	1	a	Debates require talking we are not debating we are simply voting
1878	4	a	Love this! Time management is key. Played this since it came out on all my devices
1879	1	a	Ads every time you click something
1880	5	a	Google Play only gives the bare minimum with regards to what permissions involve. This app explains in full detail the risks when an app's permissions are decidedly invasive. To those reviewers that complained what's next, what's next is now that you know what the potentially harmful apps are, and YOU decide whether to keep them or not (or root your phone to modify permissions). Thanks to this app I uninstalled a dozen spying apps and replaced them with ones with acceptable permissions. That's what's next.
1881	4	a	The hogs are hard to find, please its so hard to find them. Wish you add weather, make the player can sleep on shelter or tent or on the ground (maybe), and I think is good to make tamed creatures follow you and fight with you I LOVED THIS SO MUCH!
1882	5	a	Good job. Keep it up. The app and the themes are Just waouh
1883	5	a	מעולה. חוסך לי המון זמן
1884	5	a	It's a good and relaxing app
1885	5	a	It's different .I really like it.
1886	1	a	Every stinkin time I try to move left it goes right,every time I try to move right it goes left this game sucks
1887	4	a	Great app. Love recording music concepts and saving them to pick apart and use at a later date.  Just one issue: I am no longer able to access my recorded files through the app. However, I can still play them through another media player. Every time I click on 'My Recordings' it says 'unfortunately MicDroid has stopped working'. Hope you can fix the issue. Thanks.
1888	5	a	This app gets 5 stars from me, works well, and it has the best sense of humour I've ever seen with the loadshedding bull we have to deal with.
1889	1	a	Android dumped this company for a reason
1890	5	a	It's a good  app
1891	3	a	This app is difficult to set up, as the fonts won't resize small enough to fit in the widget if you include the date and time. You can only use the smallest fonts.  Otherwise it is a good solid app I would recommend.
1892	4	a	App is great for keeping track of schedule/sessions at TC17. Tech support personale are awesome!!!
1893	4	a	I've mostly used this for the NES, and it works great, except the volume control doesn't seem to work right. Usually I use headphones, both bluetooth and wired, and the only way over found to adjust the volume is go to the audio settings and adjust both channels. Also it doesn't have a speed adjustment option. Given both of those, I'd give it five stars. It could also use an auto save option, and/or keep the most recent three quick saves.
1894	2	a	Don't Understand.  Worked great until I tried to upload a .svg file from another application.  All I got was a transparent layer on the screen.  Can't use it for my work.  Sorry I paid for it.
1895	1	a	Used to be quite good, but this update deletes all progress and limits you to the first hundred levels unless you purchase more. I had reached 200 and something before. Absolutely terrible practice to push this kind of update without warning of the consequences.
1896	5	a	Going from doing 20 inspections by hand to on an app that works as smoothly as this  has been a real time saver. Would recommend  this  to  any property  manager.
1897	1	a	So, SO many adds. Everytime I open to make a note, I start typing, then after a few letters a huge imposing add opens up, taking me into my browser, and costing me a good 20/30 seconds. Doesn't sound terrible, but when I intent to scribe somethinng down to remember later, I expect it to take only a few seconds. Far too messy to be functional.
1898	5	a	I have a few weeks to see the new one is not the way of this game
1899	5	a	so far it's a pretty kool app! .. haven't gotta use it yet, literally just \ndownloaded it \u0026\u0026 set it up.. but, it looks like a pretty awesome app, also \nhas pretty nice things to buy! ((let's just hope the items are as nice as \nthey look in the advertisements!!? .. 😜)) can't wait to actually purchase \nsomethin tho to see the quality of it in person!! 👗👙🎀 😊😊😊
1900	1	a	Vaya castaña de aplicación... No entiendo todavía bien para que sirve. Los check in los validan tarde y no sirven para validar los puntos de las estancias. En fin, que solo vale para tenernos entretenidos y localizados.
1901	4	a	This is great but make it more challenging. And there should be an option when player wins he may get the result immidiatly who losed
1902	5	a	Its a great game offline game fun to play good story line easy controls and \namazing graphics this is a great game yall keep it up amazing job with this \none
1903	4	a	Could not connect to Bluetooth device. Edit - I needed additional commands to negotiate connection. The UI for typing is pretty bad, but the app does work.
1904	1	a	Was never able to create a account.
1905	1	a	I usually like this kind of games..but I don't like this one...specially when u need to serve each ingredient separately to the client...uninstalling
1906	4	a	The old version was much better with all the list so I am going to delete \nit if you do not bring easy apps
1907	5	a	Game plays slightly different from the board game. Great adaption. Want a Yog-Sothoth campaign. If players are having trouble in the game,  I suggest they try different investigators. Some are better against different Elder Gods than others and in the campaigns your investigator picks can doom you from the start. SO CHOOSE WISELY! That being said, there are also some you should never take into a campaign. But half the fun is figuring out which ones you need to be successful. I,ve beaten every campaign. They all will take multiple attempts to win.  Good luck fighting the Old Ones. :-)
1908	4	a	Great tactical squad game. Brought back the nostalgia of UFO: Enemy Defence I played yonder years ago. Too bad this android version had many sound issues (eg. soldiers and voice-over sound works for a few times after start game and then would simply stop working). Music works and is suitably done.
1909	4	a	Found the vocabulary of letter A but could not download more themes
1910	4	a	I find it was convenient, fun, easy and fast to learn Kanji. However there's one mistake I manage to spot and that was the meaning for 'ushiro' which means 'behind' but instead was taught as 'after'. Overall, it's a great app  to refresh one's Kanji.
1911	4	a	Good game except it's  very hard to use items from your inventory which makes for slow game play. Has interactive  map but no legend making it almost useless. Played demo will not purchase.
1912	5	a	Rất tốt, tác giả nên bổ sung thêm theme
1913	3	a	You can play the tutorial and a bit of the campaigns with plenty of stops for ADS but to advance past that you must pay to upgrade are you will be destroyed by the people that did pay! there is absolutely no way you'll ever advance for free and experience neither counts for anything nor buys you anything. I may pay for the game if they compromised a little on that. hence the 3 stars
1914	5	a	This game is so lovely
1915	5	a	I like it because it is about pandas
1916	3	a	Only thing that would need fixing is the bosses attacks they attack frequently and some bosses just completely destroy all you're tiles which is most likely unfair you barely can get 2 Chains without a boss destroying the tiles you were gonna press
1917	1	a	My cat mittens didn't like it at all I didn't like it ether. It made my cat made at me then my cat scratch me mittens never scratches me
1918	5	a	Is a great way to learn the Bible
1919	5	a	Game launches fine. Excellent title. A brilliantly crafted runner that doesn't automatically assume you're an idiot with no hope in life. I'd love for you guys to apply yourselves to a real effort though. Runners are light mobile thinking games. I shiver at what you could do with player controlled gameplay and a story. Platformer RPG ala Metroid perhaps?
1920	2	a	Doesn't go into sleep mode for Oneplus 5T
1921	5	a	Amazing, I couldn't stop playing! Thank you
1922	5	a	Love this app! I just hope there will be more icons in the future since after a few years of use, it would be nice for a lot of newer ones
1923	4	a	Anyone having issues with the extra features (text notifications, call log) on a LG Nexus 5? I installed the software on my phone but it doesn't show up in the notification bar. I cannot access the extra features at all. With another phone (sony xperia z2) it does work perfectly fine, so maybe it's not supported on LG Nexus 5 devices?
1924	4	a	It's a lot better than I thought it would be. I really like it, fustrates the hell outta me sometimes.. but hey what's life without a little difficulty.
1925	5	a	It fun I love to shop and give and take help others I believe it a great game I just wish. U could buy more things in the   expand and furniture  area with money than with diamonds some things money won't buy lol ty great game  a minister that play this ty
1926	5	a	I almost didn't download this app due to the poor rating, but I'm SO glad I did! I really can't see how it's possible that they're running at a 3.8⭐ rating. I have yet to have any major problems with this app and I've had it on and off of multiple different devices over several years.     I love this app, it works perfectly for me, much better than others I've tried. 3 different scanners for my tiny county in Wisconsin. The advertisements really aren't terrible either.   The ONLY problem I have, is that sometimes it's difficult to close! Even after closing all of my apps on my phone, it remains running and the icon is still on my drop-down menu. This never WAS an issue with earlier versions of this app. Would love to know if/when it's been fixed! Thanks for the great app, guys!  Would recommend to just about anyone. Give it a shot!
1927	4	a	Please improve controlls, make them bigger or get d-pad to work. Big papi fan, I have all the games. Update please - htc wildfire
1928	4	a	I don't know how to set it and it only has a Uninstall button not a button where it says open then you ajust it and it says PUT AS WALLPAPER but....otherwise good!
1929	4	a	" and those who finished it in a day?  Do you have special psychic powers? Are you robots? Skeptical."""
1930	5	a	God game  death doom!!
1931	5	a	Good           Good
1932	4	a	This game actually perfect in every aspect. All the fans of romance + splice of life anime and love sim combined will love this game. However, it really hurts on how very small part of the story showed for a single energy consumed. And it worsened by the 4 hours long replenish time... For a single energy?! I wish it wouldnt take that long to recover all the energy.
1933	5	a	Keren gamenya, ga ngebosenin. Apalagi kalo bsa online dan ada storynya
1934	3	a	Cukup bagus....tapi kok tidak ada pilihan camera untuk NMTC, JASAMARGA , etc....
1935	5	a	You guys have to be carfu
1936	4	a	Really???? What are the updates all about????? Had about 3 now.
1937	5	a	It's so good you're family will love it I do and I'm 51years old
1938	4	a	Fun. Would like something to switch it up like different challenges
1939	5	a	It is so easy to use the app and it store all your pictures
1940	5	a	i used this keyboard from my SG young, SG ace, SG3, SG4 \u0026 my SG note 3... \nnow my SG note 4... it makes the phone look classy in my eyes!!! smooches!
1941	5	a	10 stars. I make drone prototypes as hobby. And this app measures my helicopters blade pitch perfectly. All other fancy apps I tried can not measure angles using a photo on the background. This app beats all others.
1942	5	a	Ik gebruik deze app alle dagen als Belgische buitenlander.
1943	3	a	Used it for a transfer ownership. very confusing and still took two days. Best part is that you need to pay 3kr to get an sms to check if it has been transferred.
1944	5	a	This is one of the very few chromatic tuner apps that covers the upper range of the violin, the lower half of the eighth octave.  The most amazing thing, which is going to take a while to verify, is that setting the temperament root to a key seems to cause the perfect intervals to fall in the correct place as well as the more difficult seconds and sevenths. For example, a B in the key of C is not the same as the B in the key of E for string players.
1945	4	a	Dear fat fish, I cant seem to unlock the achievement whereby I share my score. Please check into the problem. Love this game btw!
1946	3	a	I think its good for my brother
1947	3	a	Gave 3 stars in hope that the author will make it work...
1948	1	a	Where is my random IO test result? I literally don't know how to view the detailed results
1949	1	a	It takes nearly a minute for it to first connect, then after another 20 seconds or so it disconnects automatically. Does this all the time when I try to connect to my Google Chromecast.
1950	5	a	It is a very nice game........
1951	3	a	Great but needs some improvement :) Idk yet right now but will f I have an \nidea I'll say (no matter how likely u r to reply :( )
1952	5	a	Loved it it was so funny and amazing
1953	3	a	Needs update, more options and ability to place ships next to each other. Plus add Google play achievements.
1954	1	a	Not working on my note 8
1955	4	a	It does work. You select your package from dropdown then tap the tick at \ntop of screen again. Works for me. Saves having a hard copy and input of \nall emergency numbers. Lovely Emma at Barclays told me about it.
1956	1	a	Where in the hell do you get the pin!
1957	5	a	Its all in one video recorder, editor, costomizer, uploader and overall compact in size.. having super fun with this amazing tool.
1958	5	a	Nice work for brain competiting with people all over the world
1959	5	a	I must strongly recommend this app to those with an interest on particle physics and CERN. I was interested but didn't know much, but this app soon changed that! A highly informative and simply laid out app.
1960	3	a	Everytime I change the tone or turning it, it goes negative or at least instead of turning it make it just scroll it up and down or put it on the settings so at least it couldn't be hard
1961	3	a	Great game but needs more levels I passed each of them about ten times!
1962	5	a	I'm not telling a lie it's beautiful just awesome  thank you for sharing  with us kudos I am Indian  so it's great that people  like  you created this peaceful scenery
1963	1	a	This is not a cool app they have an option for you to share ur mpesa \nhistory but are requesting clients to send either a ksh 50 to get their \nloan details verified how silly.
1964	1	a	Load of crap,  keeps asking for e-mail address  then when you give it to them they tell you it's invalid even though it's the same e-mail address I have been using for my online account with them and everyone else for about 15 years now, strange how it still works for everything else though .DELETE.
1965	5	a	Alhamdullillah...baru terase mati tu dekat sangat..
1966	3	a	Every time I do something like save or try and create a new gun it shows an ad and it does the same when I'm done.
1967	5	a	THANK YOU! Had some pdfs that were just not cutting it in the pdf readers available. Was starting to tear my hair out but - no more! This worked like a dream AND I can now read the documents in my fav eReader that I've grown so attached to.
1968	2	a	Shuts down often. Can only do basic search -one search criteria at a time.
1969	1	a	Unable to connect device. .Retrying 23x. . Uninstalled Description for this app is perfectly correct with the app function but I can't connect using Bluetooth. So sad T.T
1970	1	a	Sve je manje vise ok...al ko god da smislja asocijacije skrenite mu paznju da se malo skine s teskih droga...mi sto se ne drogiramo ne vidimo izgleda logiku istim ocima ko ovi nadrogirani..
1971	1	a	Can't create a account it keeps on saying I have an account I don't even fb log in it fails even fb log in even Google log in what kind of online game can't create other ids? Worst plus no action
1972	5	a	بسیار عالی فعلا یه دست ناپلئونی باختم 😀
1973	4	a	"I really want this thing but i cant seem to find the \go contacts ex app\"" it always say that the item cant be found.. i need some help.. i really want this"""
1974	3	a	Too many logos, where you can see the name on most of it :( And I'd like it better if there was color search option for unsolved logos. If I need to find a logo but I can't remember the exact level where it is, it would be nice that I could see 'all red unsolved logos' or something
1975	4	a	Waaaaahhhhhh it's like the normal pixle dungeon
1976	5	a	Very Good Work. If it display English \u0026 Tamil on same side it will be most useful.
1977	1	a	Its a nice app but if u want a positive outcome u need to opt first option seems to be the logic.
1978	4	a	I liked the story that went on here, and I'd like to see another game elaborating on it. The loss of body parts truly added a bit of challenge to this game and freshened the platformer genre. This was much shorter than I expected, but that's fine considering this was made in 2 days. The only issue that I have with this game is that the controls aren't always as responsive as they should be; sometimes I head into the opposite direction I press or the jump button is delayed. Aside from that, well done!
1979	5	a	Tremendous. Soon to build a home. Garlinghouse ... Thank you.🌷
1980	1	a	"It takes some considerable brain twisting to work out what the developers were thinking when they set the app up. The workflow is a complete mess. To add a new exercise to an existing routine while you're going through it takes way too long and doesn't seem to work half the time.  Switching devices is a nightmare. You sync from one device to Dropbox but then the new device just shrugs: \The operation could not be performed\"" when you try to restore that data to it. No clue as to where to start looking. Lazy noob programming.  I would dump it and try something else but I've paid for the pro upgrade so I feel kind of compelled to get my money's worth."""
1981	1	a	I do not like this game because dinosaur fly very Low and other dinosaur \ncan only killed by the feet if you add the bullets so it will be best game
1982	4	a	Its helps  us to improve  our  self confidence. If you want to remove your fear against like gd. int. hr;  then you should use this app.
1983	5	a	Game show style play. Great and addictive.  Hope future updates have an real time multi play mode option with back and forth questioning style all the way up to the bonus round and then add all the points up throughout whole game and bonus round highest score wins. Thank you for listening. Can't wait to see the new updates lol.
1984	5	a	I like the owl it is so cute
1985	5	a	I can't find a problem with it. And the controls are pretty good! Though the nav mode jumps out at you sometimes. It's a great game! I don't get why people say the controls suck.
1986	5	a	BEST GAME OF ALL TIME!
1987	2	a	To tell the truth, it took a long time to load this. I was excited to play it, but **** the game went off after it loads. LOL waste of time I guess...
1988	5	a	Best app, I love the search function! Make life easier to search for the station am looking for.
1989	1	a	I bought the PRO version, suddenly it's not optimised for my device, and \ncan't leave feedback on its functionality. Be aware.
1990	1	a	Kameran funkar inte på min OnePlus 3T.
1991	1	a	I don't like this tunes. Very very bad
1992	4	a	My cat won't play plus it keeps crashing
1993	5	a	This app was the best.  I tried using the aa theory test book which was £12.99 (not worth it), but all I really needed was this app. It has hundreds of questions and explanations for when you're learning. It also has the highway code split into sections (which book shops also charge a ridiculous amount for).          Thankyou developers!
1994	4	a	Great game, but it needs more levels and a way to reset scores if one so chooses.
1995	5	a	چطور کیبوردو  فعالش کنم😳
1996	5	a	Database kosakata nya cukup membantu belajar bagi pemula
1997	1	a	Nothing to write home about. No flair ur either vertical or horizontal. Maybe if you could do several at a time.
1998	4	a	Nice graphics  but I'm worried  of the impact  dying with all that blood, flesh, sounds  can have  on psychologicaly unstable   people. It's  quiet  creepy. But it's challenging,  difficult . Затягивает, нужно точно рассчитывать время  удерживания  кнопки,для тех кто любит точность
1999	5	a	I thimk that this is the world's best game
2000	5	a	so nice app iam very happy
2001	2	a	Good game for Christmas. After you get to a certain level, matches do not show up enough unless you're willing to pay for help! THANKS GRINCH!!!
2002	2	a	pls add feature to receive text from the Share function of android, why \nmust you copy an event text from a website and then ooen this app and paste \nit in the field?? when you just copy the text from any where, webpage, pdf, \nsms text, email and then use android share to send that text to your app \nfor processing... much simpler
2003	5	a	Plsss make free the concert hall!! couse its lock. CONCERT HALL is only good in thats apps
2004	5	a	Great job of the most important thing
2005	4	a	I liked it. Make it more useful.
2006	5	a	Why is that when I had a notification tune it's not ringing??
2007	5	a	Отличное и качественное приложение! Мозг начинает дымить и это хорошо :)
2008	1	a	The latest update crashes every time someone leave the app on background \nand return. I used to prefer this app over the others but now I cannot \nstand it anymore.
2009	1	a	Can't create a watch zone without a profile. Creating a profile goes to a white screen, with nothing in it. Can't log in with profile, it flashes a message when I try, but I can't read it in the millisecond it is visible. So, in simple terms, it is literally useless.
2010	5	a	Another winner. Hope you're working on number 3.
2011	2	a	Takes ages to wait for more levels boring
2012	4	a	This game is very addictive and entertaining but when I use the Blaziet sometimes it doesn't work but that's beside the point , this game is great 🙏🙏😸
2013	1	a	What a great game (not)
2014	3	a	Helps pass time, but too sensitive. If you try to swipe through items it will purchase them about half the time. I have lost so much money due to this problem.
2015	2	a	This app is not working on Lenovo phones please don't Download this app
2016	4	a	This works great with my tab with the HC  zoom / stretch function.  After upgrade to ICS, the stretch function is  no longer there.  The font is now too small.
2017	5	a	It was fun but you should be able to steal the bases on your comand. And the graphics worn't so good.you should be able. Throw the ball to any base you want to. Kinda good
2018	1	a	My eldest just lost all his progress for the third time. He loves the game but ends up crying when he looses all his trophies. This application would be five stars otherwise.
2019	5	a	I'm 10 and when I first got this app was scared to found ghost all over the house. Then I started reading what they were saying. This good ghost was sitting next to me and it seemed like it was protecting me from the aggressive ghost. I love this app I recommend it for everyone!
2020	4	a	i luv gluten free games and this one to! but when i fly i imedietly go forwards and its very hard to control, i dont want to bother you guys but can you try to fix it??LUV U😙
2021	3	a	Not very quick puzzles, ad the name implies.
2022	5	a	Nice update from older one, I simply love that your work
2023	5	a	Cara melihat saldo popcard korea
2024	2	a	The free version is rather poor. It won't follow the hebrew right to left rule for sequence of words though it respects it for single words.
2025	5	a	Best fart game in world
2026	4	a	I see a feature for downloads and playlist but not any way to use them. Still, its relaxing classical song choices. Beats the beck outa techno lullaby music and we both can enjoy it too relax and quiet the mind as part of a nighttime routine. Wish it had a timer though so it doesn't run down my phone. Being able to include my own music too would be a nice feature.
2027	5	a	I like this game so much because it makes very beautiful beauty full designs it is the best game of the world I gave 5  stars to its  game gameplay and graphics make the games like this only thanks for making this
2028	5	a	It help me diagnose my tablet's issue. Thank for making this app.
2029	5	a	Love the night light feature where you can control the intensity and colors. Great for reading at night.
2030	5	a	I like the game but I have one minor problem with it. There is no default ranged weapon that does not run out of ammo. I'm ending up dying because all of the range monsters are killing me and I can't kill them first. It's just annoying to be left helpless when u run out of ammo.
2031	1	a	this is very boring game.
2032	5	a	I like it  It is awesome 🙋
2033	3	a	Its just ok. Not enough customizing options
2034	5	a	I like it, but its really slow when submitting photos to the public gallery. Overall.. 8/10 its very good.
2035	5	a	This game is so great. Well its funny becuse my rivals is stuck in a desert.
2036	1	a	"I purchased the other dragon on my other phone but I am UNABLE to restore my purchase, it ALWAYS SAYS \purchase failed\""!!!"""
2037	5	a	"This app was working great prior to the latest update last November (I think) but now it logs me out without warning after a few seconds. I recently inquired as to why and apparently First Citizens Bank is aware of this issue. They stated, \the IT department is working on this issue.\"" UPDATE: I have recently noticed the bank app has been performing normal again on my phone in the past 2 or 3 weeks. I never heard back from the IT support since my last inquiry. Thank you IT support in advance."""
2038	5	a	It wont leave me alone

2040	4	a	This app is one way to not get looted by other enemies for 46 minutes, creator of this app if you are reading this plz make it so it can give you a one day shield, plz, thank you if you are reading this. 😃
2041	1	a	"Já testei em vários smartphones e \crasha\"" sempre."""
2042	5	a	Its a good social app
2043	5	a	This  very  good  app
2044	3	a	Some chapters mcq questions are not show it is the big problem ..but this aap is ok not best..
2045	2	a	Merge sacadat pe tel octa core cu 2 GB RAM :(
2046	1	a	My truck is maxed out on the accelerator and the speedometer doesn't go past zero. Clutch is fully dropped. Takes me over a minute a half to finish a run. After I finish a run I lose money.  Either make a how to guide or update the game.
2047	4	a	But it's don't has a full unit
2048	4	a	It is easy to send sms
2049	5	a	I really like sudoku!! Very nice concept and really well made!!
2050	1	a	All it is is instructions  I can't have pocket adisian  and I need Minecraft NOW!!!!!!!!
2051	1	a	I bought the full version... And regretted it.  The demo had great (if easy) puzzles.  The full version is full of hostile bots that need to be dodged.  I wanted a puzzle game... Not an action game that needs precise controls far better than a touch screen game pad who's buttons are WAY too close together.  Wish I could get my money back.
2052	5	a	Love this game it sucks when you use your lives up and have to wait for them to build up but it is challenging and if you earn a lot of coins its easy to beat the harder levels cause you can buy reverse and bombs and so on I just beat the game didn't want to end this one is by far my fav out of all the Zuma games  please make another one
2053	5	a	It is a very good game i figured out that when you turn the camra around you can take s picture of your face you can make a necklace  by making  it bigger or smaller and you can flip them upside down.👍
2054	1	a	It sounds like a retarded blonde speaking bad app also dont get it I speak english too
2055	3	a	Fantastic for beginners, thanks but pls can u upgrade and put more examples 😀
2056	2	a	I am sick of the constant notifications, I just got five notifications within the course of one minute. If the notifications would stop being so numerous this game would be much more enjoyable.
2057	5	a	Card could be given in the command way
2058	1	a	I just deleted all of my applications but it steel says there isnt enough space.hate it
2059	5	a	It helps me on my tests so... basically.... ITS AWESOME

2061	3	a	It's a bit much that is about every minute to Jan an ad down our throats so we can keep playing. I'd rather pay a dollar for an ad free game...
2062	5	a	Viskas, ko reikia. Viskas veikia puikiai! Geriausia tai, kad widgetai tikrai labai patogus. Aciu autoriui!
2063	5	a	I love it.... Very much
2064	5	a	Amazing Sudoku game, I really like it!!
2065	4	a	This VR app helps me get to sleep at night. I just strap on my headset, play some classical music in the background, and lay back imagining I'm on a snowy mountaintop far far away...
2066	1	a	Did three tests all while lying in bed within 20 seconds of the first. First one was 80, second was 100 and third was 90.  Too inaccurate for me.
2067	5	a	I love this app \u0026 the others that I have on my cellphone. I look at these almost everyday, have told some of my friends about this, sent some of these messages to my girlfriend, they help me feel the spirit, \u0026 remind me of Jesus Christ and Heavenly Father. The way they remind me of God \u0026 Jesus Christ is that they love us more than anyone else and they've done the most for us!
2068	1	a	It is terrible they say you're going to get 10 more games and you don't you get about 5 or 4 they're not even teaching math they're teaching recycling how to put toast into a toaster what goes in the dishwasher I thought it would be good but no it was good for a little bit but did it was teaching nothing word to the wise I want to get this not good for kids😡😡😠😠
2069	1	a	Worst app ever by Dialog.
2070	4	a	Try add some countries like Philippines and etc. Pls..unlock the other countries as well. For example if a player wins a trophie, then one of the countries will be unlock. For sure, many people will download and enjoy this game.    -sorry for bad English.... :)
2071	5	a	I like the update. But now syncing for multiple devices \u0026 google drive back up is urgent. Could you please add this option???? Also need widget for easily note taking. Hope we will get these soon.
2072	2	a	It doesn't really work, maybe I'm doing it wrong but I was excited, call me naive. I was excited and it didn't work
2073	5	a	Great and great and greater!
2074	2	a	I can't read the names of the songs. The print is a very pale, light gray \ncolor on a black background with no easy to change the text color so that \nit's readable at all. Under the songs tab you can't tell what song you are \nlooking at without playing it. The text needs to be readable or else it's \nunusable.
2075	4	a	Love this app.  You can find a few different ringtones that are not on most apps.
2076	1	a	Don't wast the time downloading it is not even a game
2077	5	a	When is the part 2 gonna come out?
2078	1	a	Does not show on Yr tab at all 👎👎👎👎👎
2079	5	a	I'm using the fall wallpaper I found on Zedge \u0026 I got to add more pink color to the orange falling leaves \u0026 I absolutely love it!!! So cool...
2080	3	a	The game like subway surver
2081	1	a	There are much better food diaries available
2082	5	a	I like the voice and the music And I especially like the continuous loop feature. It takes some of us longer to go to sleep then others.
2083	1	a	It keeps opening the store during the game and the cotrol sucks also very few missions then it's over! Waste of data don't download
2084	4	a	Seems ok and I'm just trying it out for the first time...hope to win something some day. EVO 3D
2085	1	a	I loved the game very much.                       BUT  When I was playing,opened stage 2. Was opening a bus, it opened, when I was going to play it fell and no controls were working.  But still I loved the game...
2086	3	a	الشكر موصول للقائمين على هذا العمل الرائع... رجاءاً الاستعانة بأهل الخبرة \nفي البرمجة... البرنامج لا يعمل.... الفكرة رائعة و لكن البرنامج كله مشاكل
2087	5	a	Alhumdulillah Allahu Akbar ♡ ♥ ○ ● □ ■ ▶ ☆ ★
2088	4	a	Would give 5* of it would keep changing colors, I set it to but sticks on red.
2089	5	a	Great game for passing the time while waiting at an appointment or riding the Metro.  Requires some skill but it is mostly a game of chance.
2090	1	a	Don't don't download  it.......
2091	3	a	It needs optimised slow loading choppy and it kicks u out optimise the game I will give a better review it can be a good game but not right now
2092	5	a	So fun even my mom play it too
2093	5	a	Reminds me of the Neko Atsume game out, but with cute seals.
2094	1	a	Don't bother waiting on an update, been waiting two months. Still no fix....
2095	5	a	Looks great! I love Rocket Player for keeping up with smart playlists, and this theme makes it even better.
2096	1	a	App keeps restarting . Took me 15 tries to manage the booking
2097	1	a	I got Turbo Dismount off of Steam and was really impressed. I then got it here and it was still hilarious. But this... This is not good. It's super slow and lacks a lot of substance. So just get Turbo Dismount instead.
2098	1	a	Alright guys you think it looks cool but really it doesn't because it looks fine but really isn't because you don't get the bomb and it also says unfortunately bomber plane has stopped so please do not download this I rated it one star because it is the most stupidest game in the world I hate it absolutely hate it do not download it all even though it looks cool it's really not
2099	2	a	Well when ever i go nd try to activate this app it says this app collect all ur personal data such as credit card  number nd other saved passwords i mean what is this? Can u plz calarify it.... plz reply!!
2100	5	a	Use to track market and also futures. Best app for this I have ever had
2101	5	a	One off the best status app in my life...
2102	5	a	O a ta bara changa way. Good oye
2103	4	a	Excellent but how do you transfer notes to a new phone?
2104	4	a	"There's a bug that happens all the time. Progress bar doesn't match the numeric value, there's only a small part colored in, when the value is way above recommended amount. After changing the date (just pressing date icon and \Done\"") the bars get colored in properly. Other than that it's a really good app. I had to laugh at another reviewer who isn't aware that \""kcal\"" means calories and gave this app two stars because of that."""
2105	1	a	Gay try tu gj hzshgww yay y y uh it
2106	1	a	Hello, Just wanted to know why i just can't install the application on my tablette? It get downloaded but when it comes to install, it just doesn't Please fix it
2107	2	a	only wallpaper changed...why are the icons not changed.
2108	5	a	Very nicely done with attention to detail. Even I love it, not counting my kids :)
2109	5	a	I'm an A\u0026P student and right now we're studying the skeleton and this is incredibly detailed and so helpful! Thank you so much!!!
2110	1	a	Now it has lost most of it's functionality. No more timer, or stopwatch, among others. Why even remove them? Will be uninstalling at least until it becomes decent again. 2 Stars only because GO is great and I believe they will fix this awful update. (Edit) Now it seems that GO is buying ratings... 1Star. :(
2111	4	a	The game is good.the only thing remains is that it's not 3d
2112	4	a	It not that bad I guess
2113	5	a	bt i didnt have any equipments to play. this app is very use full for me. thanks
2114	1	a	Stopped keeping the correct time on my ThinQ, was always delayed even with \nthe setting set to prevent that from happening. Then didn't update itself \nunless I swapped screens \u0026 back again. Used to be my perfect, #1 app. Not \nanymore \u0026 I'm sad. Uninstalled :(
2115	1	a	change is not permanent.my contacts stored on sim card appear in my contact list and they change to 8digit when 1 add 5 to it using the app.however it goes back to 7digit when I restart the phone. There is no synch i haven't enabled synch.
2116	4	a	It is a good visual novel with fantastic artwork. Progress through the story unless you are willing to pay is very slow.   I understand having the energy system in place and approve of it. I do believe that  4 hours per energy bar for about a minute of reading is a bit much. I think it would be better to either lower the waiting time to 3 hours, lower the cost of the delux subscription or offer a one time purchase per story which would unlock everything for a selected character.   I do enjoy it and would recommend it people, but I feel it could be streamlined which would encourage more people to use it and generate revenue for you
2117	1	a	Worst game ever played.This game cannot start. Thank you
2118	1	a	Doesn't work on my Nexus 6 with marshmallow. Followed instructions given by other reviewers.
2119	1	a	Makes you assume that it can control the toy.
2120	1	a	This app NEVER works when you are actually at the outlets
2121	3	a	This game was really terrifying for me. Even on the third night I was still flustered and scared when the jump scares came. I was impressed with the game for how it stayed scary. However by night 3, I was also getting really frustrated with the game mechanics. You couldn't do anything when Springtrap finally came and I don't know how to prevent him from coming. I started to become less scared and more agrivated.
2122	5	a	Artwork and audio is great.
2123	4	a	It is really a good game but still need improvement. I found a little bug inside the game and it is quite annoying. Threre is no exit button in main menu, i hope you can add the exit button. Overall it is a good game.
2124	1	a	I installed it in my MotoG2. Its not translating even a single word. Please guide me how to use it. Thanks
2125	4	a	Great collection of love quotes, but I would like it even better if the developer adds a random quote button.  In the meantime, I give the list of pages a fast flick to choose a random page.
2126	5	a	johar  YSR jai  JAGAN
2127	4	a	I love the app, really keeps me organized however is there a way to make it password protected to prevent snooping kids?
2128	2	a	You say this update improves screen real estate yet the excel app now has a big bar at the top that just shows the file name and icon for file menu.  Takes up entirely too much space. Remove it or add an option to hide it!!!
2129	3	a	Seems to happen a lot with these vr apps, so its a shame to have it repeated with this app
2130	1	a	it's an Advertising deceiving app.
2131	5	a	Perfect eggs! Delish. Love the medium boil.
2132	5	a	Idenya bagus. Tp kesannya aplikasi buat pencari kerja. Saran bisa dipisahkan antara alumni pencari kerja dgn alumni yg mencari tenaga kerja. InsyaAlloh banyak alumni yg sudah berwirausaha bisa berkontribusi menampung lulusan.
2133	4	a	It helps me a lot to perform multitask operations...I luv it
2134	4	a	I like it because u can use u r brain
2135	1	a	Appen henger seg ofte opp så jeg må lukke den og åpne på nytt igjen. Spesielt når den har vært åpen en stund. Radio fungerer svært dårlig. Beklager NRK. Jeg hadde forventet mer av dere. Skal ikke NRK være en riks kringkaster tilgjengelig på alle plattformer?
2136	2	a	After installing and applying the theme, I saw no difference between the default apollo theme and this one. 2 stars just for the effort.
2137	5	a	It's a great app and It totally works!
2138	5	a	I am a 3rd level reiki healer nd i loved this app
2139	5	a	Enjoyed playing this typical retro JRPG, this is my kind of retro game.  Can't add much to all the positive reviews.  Apparently the bugs have been worked out, not a single problem throughout game play.  More than one save slot would have been helpful.  The poor translation is good enough to get the info across.  It's actually unintentionally humorous at times, sort of like some of the old poorly dubbed oriental MA or SciFi cult classic movies.   Finished Gail 1 and starting on Gail 2 now.
2140	5	a	Im drunk and high at the same time. And then i tried this. Wew. Everything is weird hahaha soo cool
2141	5	a	Love being able to personalize and send to family and friends.
2142	5	a	Does exactly what it says. I really love this app.
2143	1	a	By fortress finder I assumed it would giv co-ords for an overworld fortress (the hard one to find) and not a nether fortress which is so easy to find it would probably take longer to load the app up than manually find it.....
2144	4	a	Game is great but I have been waiting for new levels for a while now. Just wondering when they will be made available
2145	1	a	Very bad game  % satisfied poor game
2146	4	a	The game is a great time waster with just enough realism to keep me comin back without getting to bogged down. in the grind
2147	5	a	I  think it was the best game on the go
2148	5	a	A must have app for andriod wear! Simple and effective! - LG G Watch R
2149	3	a	I love this app who made this app
2150	1	a	Plz shut down such apps
2151	5	a	An app I've been looking for a long time and finally, I found this. Thank you vmEyePro.
2152	3	a	...it doesn't display the time in-app. C'mon devs, if Google Maps can do it, you can add this as well. There's also the wrong Album art displayed, and I had to have it disabled. Hoping this can be updated
2153	3	a	I love this game! It's a great time killer! But how do you let her show you her chain? When I touch it she only wants me to play with her ):
2154	3	a	When it works its fine , but more often than not you won't be able to access the app on the pebble og.
2155	4	a	Kedves fejlesztők! Szeretném, ha a leírásban szerepelne egy lista, amiben leírják, hogy az engedélyek (Permissions) közül melyikre miért van szükség. Ennek hiányában a felhasználók elrettenhetnek a telepítéstől, ami igazán kár lenne egy ilyen hasznos alkalmazásnál!

2157	4	a	Very good app. But the important landscape mode is not possible ...pity!
2158	1	a	But i can't use it on new update, is unavailable on menu in new update please fix it.
2159	5	a	lots of choices, filters of many kind. my only complaint is its very combersome. but for good reason. i just dont always have the space. best editor i have ever had next to pic monkey!
2160	4	a	Really good app. Never see before. So simple and all using by simply. Good \napp for for beginner's
2161	4	a	Stuck on the first mission the stupid bronze key won't fit anywhere!Please do tell!
2162	5	a	i love to use this app. i have very little knowledge about space so this app gets me a little bit closer to understanding even our solar system
2163	5	a	My favourite of all the live wallpapers I have seen. It's both interesting and relaxing.
2164	5	a	Awesome app i came across for the first time which beautifully shows the experimental particle physics with mind blowing simulations and real time events. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
2165	1	a	Help! I have put my photos into separate albums but I can't open the albums to see my photos anymore!
2166	3	a	Great idea and a good way to reach these amazing indie artists.. Amazing app and UI.. Just few updates needed according to me.. Its showing error when I try to play after I tap and recognize a song, so I can't even bookmark it for later or to save the name of the song or artist.. And another main feature needed is a history of tapped songs.. So that if anyone want to buy or YouTube it, name will be in history..  Looking forward for updates.. Thanks..
2167	5	a	I love writing section as this part is very important for people who never used this language branch.
2168	4	a	Addictive only prob is have to restart often as stalls when opening. When are more level going to be vailable?
2169	5	a	Works really well. I thought I had a problem moving the camera but you have to wait a moment after sliding your finger.
2170	5	a	Awesome app! Exactly as I expected. Extremely user friendly and self-explanatory. Recognizes cards very quickly and remembers your game if you accidentally exit the app or shut off your device. It's a shame that there are so many poor reviews by people who don't understand how to use the app.
2171	3	a	I'm from Shanghai. Have to say there are several mistakes in pronunciations, like wrong tone in “500”, and “pian” should be “bian” in “can you repeat that”. Also though “tai hao la” does mean “excellent”, it doesnt match with the expression used, and should be replaced by “zhen bang”.
2172	5	a	Subhan Allah ma sha Allah sweeet sound
2173	5	a	Really helpfull to find file on the phone
2174	3	a	Had a quick look after installing It... looks good but just want to know if you're going to update it for the new season?
2175	5	a	Huge fan of your work! Love this theme is just one example of why.
2176	5	a	THIS IS SO AWESOME u should get human instead
2177	1	a	Very slow. Not responding to user comnands
2178	1	a	The app still crashes after the update upon opening. AT\u0026T Samsung s6 latest OS updated from att
2179	1	a	This game was short, but funny. It was definitely not worth three dollars! I'd give this game a better rating if there was more to the game. I'm just disappointed and scarred. I WANT A REFUND!!!
2180	5	a	This helps me through my depression and lots more my councilor is amazing \nand she showed me this but breathing for me doesn't work I'm only 12 it's \nsad what humanity makes little children do like for my depression it's been \nsince I was 9 and I got disorders but I have huge anger problem this apps \nhelped so much thx😙😘😚 why can't people be nice and stop bullying
2181	4	a	An amazing app. Only 1 thing missing... Where are the sharp notes? but besides that, it really helped me! (maybe add the sharp notes?)
2182	2	a	The app is in Polish which you could navigate around however it would not accept a UK telephone number so I couldn't buy train tickets...
2183	5	a	Amazing no complaints at all
2184	1	a	There's only 1 fire 2 make add more and it gets more stars
2185	4	a	Great fast-acting and comprehensive apps manager.
2186	4	a	Best app thus far that fades my blemishes!!
2187	5	a	Buena app a mi me gusta
2188	5	a	The rounded corners should be a stock UI component in android. App works great on all my devices. One thing I'm having an issue with is getting the corners to work properly with Android 5. I think the crossover with material and holo is killing the effect Roundr gives apps. I am going to keep trying to get the settings right, but the rounded effect is lost on some google apps.
2189	1	a	Very bad reviews for this app
2190	4	a	Neat little app to learn US state capitals. Please fix the time lag between each question. It takes the fun out of the timed challenge.
2191	1	a	Every single time I try to go to someone's island it works for an island or two \u0026 then it just freezes. I have to take the battery out of my phone \u0026 restart it. I LOVE this game, but social really needs to be fixed \u0026 the Valentine's Day stuff needs to be updated.
2192	5	a	I thought the game was great but, I think they should put less adds. It gets annoying from repeatedly tapping the back button on my phone.
2193	5	a	Excelent app. Didn't find another with so many nutritional details.
2194	3	a	Good idea but no need for demo every time. I keep having to input my name in to replace the silly ones chosen. Dictionary needs expanding, will not accept lots of words in Scrabble dictionaries.
2195	3	a	I installd this app but cant c it in my download. Where is it??
2196	3	a	I like the functions, but it used a huge amount of battery power. Use sparingly.
2197	5	a	This is a cool small app. Worked perfectly over xmas period monitoring our webserver. The widget is perfect I didn't once get a call nor have to manually check our servers are up. A must have app for sysadmins
2198	2	a	I like the part where the app froze repeatedly. I dont think i was doing 80 \nin a school zone...
2199	5	a	It's very creative. I've seen nothing like this. I really like the icons how its realistic and it decorated your messaging system and it also decorated your calling system too
2200	5	a	Funkar lika bra nu som förr.
2201	1	a	This app is absolutely rubbish and I am 9 and 6 and we play harp and drum :(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(
2202	1	a	Do not git this app it can not  work
2203	3	a	Waaaaay too many ads everywhere on the screen.
2204	1	a	Not what i expect from real basketball so ugly the control is so annoying 0 star for this...
2205	5	a	It's fun. There's nothing else to say.👌👍
2206	5	a	I love this app but you don't have to be guy to be President.
2207	5	a	It is superb app for Eye Drs to do smart phone fundoscopy with 20D  lens.
2208	5	a	Is really a great game! Should continue working to make such games!
2209	4	a	The iconic work of the theme should be improved since it is not so attractive. Boot animation should also be little improved
2210	4	a	The potential of this app is fantastic. I would also like, to see regional listings for the various groupings. Flower, tree, climbing vine would help encourage users who are interested in knowing the local plants. The wiki option is nice for looking at pictures before confirming a sighting.
2211	5	a	برنامج اكثر من رائع جزاكم الله خيرا
2212	4	a	This game is well made. The only thing that annoys me is the fireballs. When you barely hit one it automatically kills you. I think that you should get 3 lives. When you fall in lava you still lose automatically, but when you hit a fireball you just lose a life.
2213	1	a	Fix please!!! Keep getting error when searching!
2214	1	a	"I get kicked from the server every time I enter with the app saying \logged in from a different location \"""""
2215	4	a	Low maximum resolution.. I have a 12.1mp camera and 4K video. Only lets me use 9mp and 1080p video. Hardly any photo options like default app. Disappointing video feature since it has next to nothing added... Only a lower resolution.
2216	5	a	Beautifully designed and mind soothing season's special WPs....Thank you developers
2217	4	a	Ricettario offline♡♡♡. Ci vuole qualche piatto esotico con una preparazione facile ma che gli ingredienti siano facile da trovare nei supermercati sotto casa.
2218	2	a	The app wouldn't let me sign in to my account, but it seemed to be \nfunctional otherwise

2223	1	a	"It doesn't work. I keep getting an message saying \search error in 'thesaurus-ee'\""."""
2224	2	a	Fun but it freezes.. alot waste of money if they fix the freezing then it might be worth the money but right Now it sucks
2225	5	a	My 20 month old grandson loves this app so much so I rarely have my phone when he is around I love to see him so happy with himself thank you Pixel Envision Ltd
2226	5	a	N I C E !!!!
2227	2	a	Won't let me submit pmt. Have entered info 3x and keep getting sent back to menu.
2228	5	a	I had my reservations initially given that many game companion apps either don't work, don't work well or are just crap. This runs beautifully, doesn't require extra accounts (like Uplay)  and you get handy stuff for the game. It would be better of you could run it without data connection and send packages when you are connected to WiFi but still, it's a solid, useful and entertaining app. Well done.
2229	5	a	I love it. It looks like a nice day On the ocean.

2244	3	a	It crashes, not allowing to put it on live.  Won't let me go through pages.

2251	3	a	Have been using the paid version for years but as of a few months ago I find that the time lags and does not catch up to my phone's time until I tap on the widget. This is a very great flaw and desperately needs attention by the developer - it makes the app almost unusable due to its unreliability.
2252	2	a	По началу мог покупать и читать. После нескольких месяцев приложение перестало показывать новые выпуски, а после переустановки не показывает уже купленные выпуски.
2253	5	a	Hey mate, sorry you're getting bombarded with stupid comments saying that \nit doesn't work because they're trying to run exe games or something like \nthat. I did want to do that, but actually i tried it again, but this time \nusing it properly and it works like a charm.

2280	4	a	I would give it 5 stars but some music doesn't play if it's on my playlist like War Of Hormones-BTS. Extremely sad about that.
2281	1	a	It's in French. I have no clue what to do
2282	3	a	I bought a ringback tone a while back, they took my money but didn't give me my ring tone. I had a receipt of payment by text message, called customer service and they said that they didn't see any payment for the ringback tone...SMDH! 🤔😕😒
2283	1	a	Dont know if it's just my Samsung galaxy, since its pretty new ;but each time i try to download the app, it says invalid data package. Maybe there is something wrong with the apps contents? Or maybe its just my phone? Just i was really anxious to download it.
2284	4	a	Never mind, the screen is now jittery when touching the controls in large view…
2285	2	a	Muy básica. No funciona en Francia.

2289	5	a	Didn't even had it for 30 minutes and I love it. The parallax effect is amazing and customizable. You can also create your own wallpaper. I can tell this app was made with passion. 10 out of 10.
2290	5	a	Helps me stay focused on exercising and helps me not be lazy with exercising!
2291	1	a	This game is hell I'm trying to uninstall  this  stupid  crappie and it won't work screw it any that  even thinks about downloading  this junk don't it waste of your time  don't  say  I didn't  warn you
2292	4	a	This is not one of my favorite apps, it's good at what it does, however I'm giving it 4 stars because I like th fact that it doesn't need access to my phone and my messages and my camera like a lot of the tour carp. So thank you for that (:
2293	1	a	" waste time on changing the icon for the main app again and again. Childish and unprofessional."""
2294	2	a	Very outdated and doesn't work at all.
2295	1	a	No section to register and no info advising you where to register. Not very useful!
2296	4	a	It look's cool but still haven played it✌
2297	1	a	I wish that there was a 0 number if there was I'd  pick it
2298	5	a	Actually works. Awesome. Yeah the effect is a few secs but it's worth trying! I've wanted to try LSD \u0026 become so curious of it \u0026 it's just brilliant theirs an app that gives u the effect!
2299	5	a	It's   a  excellent   game   it's  a   good  idea  you  have  to  Dawnlod  it  you  should  pot  frots  first  then  pot  jous and  you  should  freeze  it   and  thare is  tomutsh  things  to  do  as  you   see  I wish you  like   it
2300	5	a	One of the best games I have ever played in my life.

2302	5	a	Samsung Galaxy S2, карта Украины и поиск работают довольно быстро, интерфейс интуитивно понятный. Обновление с демо до полной версии прошло без проблем.
2303	1	a	It's to short I hate it sorry to be a hater
2304	1	a	It keeps on kicking me off! It sucks like the 1st one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT DOWN LOAD IT GUYS ALL IT DOES IS TAKE UP YOUR TIME!!!!!! I WAS TRYING TO TALK TO MY GIRL FRIEND AND I CALLED THIS APP STUPID AND SHE THOUGHT I WAS TALKING TO HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2305	5	a	if you make widget for geomagnetic conditions it would be great
2306	4	a	Hahahahahahhha..  CUTE.. You just need to improve the way of typing the words.. I can't easily understand some of them..
2307	5	a	Work fine but I'm not  sure how many you can missed on it because it don't said
2308	4	a	I really really enjoy this game. Its addicting but I've made it a decent way through and now it just keeps crashing.  I want to keep playing. Please fix. I don't want to have to delete this app because of crashing issues

2312	4	a	The game is fun and easy. Very addictive and I just can't put it down.
2313	5	a	Everyone should download this game, it is my favorite game I have ever played in my life! Why isn't this game more popular? Don't change anything it is great the way it is. I recommend everyone gets it!
2314	1	a	But otherwise nothing happens. It doesn't even save the entries I put in.

2343	2	a	Why the photo result is always pink when i take pictures from the app? Not good. Uninstall.
2344	3	a	Make it the old game show for 4.5. 0r more stars
2345	4	a	Hacking impossible  but to hack. we need to Call tom cruise for mission impoßible 6
2346	4	a	An interesting turn based game, reminds me of HOMM. Took a while to figure out how to cast the spells well but after turns realised it could be done anywhere on the screen
2347	1	a	Does not work at all on my Galaxy S5, and no way to set timed recording. Sucks!
2348	3	a	Great concept, poor programming; application crashes every time at exit; after recent update it's using only a small part of the phone screen - so super difficult to read.
2349	4	a	Thought this is an excellent app and I used to love it, it always stop working on my Galaxy Note 5. I have tried to reinstall, it works the first night or so and then in sudden nothing at all. Sad, I am missing it a lot....
2350	3	a	Daily Duration: please add acivation time during the day. Can't stop notification when i am sleeping

2352	3	a	The things you so is kinda cheesy maybe this is because it's not the upgraded version
2353	5	a	I like it calculates as you input then shows a history that can then be edited.

2358	3	a	Popups happen too much. And trick you into opening them while your typing in the answer. Restart the game when you get stuck. Jfk
2359	1	a	i can't find what i am searching for its a nice app for other vut not for me
2360	2	a	Nie widzę opcji żeby wyświetlić numer konta (żeby komuś go podać na przykład). Można wejść do historii jakiejś transakcji i zobaczyć numer odbiorcy/nadawcy, ale to trochę droga dookoła. Przydałaby się opcja przesłania komuś numer konta za pomocą sms/email lub chociaż skopiowania go.

2370	5	a	Close internet conn to get rid of add at the top
2371	5	a	I love this app. I use it all the time to look up words/characters, as well as to hone my vocabulary using the Random button. The Cantonese support is a Godsend.
2372	5	a	I migrate from MIUI to cm10 and i miss rounded screen in miui. Then i found this awsome app. Now i have a perfect look in my cm10 xperia SP.  Thanks a lot.
2373	4	a	Hindu grantho ka resarch kar better app banai hai
2374	1	a	Games got good ideas but boring  and hard to play
2375	1	a	It searches for a few seconds but wont find my device. The app is one of the main reasons i got this instead of any other speaker. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!! Update: STILL DOESN'T WORK trying to use the app for months, FIX THIS!
2376	3	a	Not bad but do get bored w/it quickly should have more sound effects to choose from.
2377	1	a	Every time when I press day it will try and load and then it's brings me back to play store no matter how many times I press it therefore  I can't play it.  I will give more stars if the problem is fixed.
2378	3	a	Their is no end goal, I wasted like 3 hours of my life on this game and you can't turn around
2379	4	a	The app is surprisingly motivating - I never realized simple positive stimuli could be so effective. There are a few things that could turn it from good to great - enable logging of events (as in record and archive the habits we've checked - maybe for a week) so we can be sure of what we've marked and review our week's activity or progress; and also a sort feature.
2380	3	a	Good, but i finished in 10 minutes
2381	3	a	I was going to use it for customising my home screen and use custom icon from icon packs, but this app does not support icon packs... It would have been so cool
2382	5	a	The widget can be adapted to the users liking colour wise and looks very nice if placed properly, an all round useful tool
2383	1	a	Evy time this stupid seed dies it takes away my coins and remove bomb birds
2384	5	a	I dont know why so many people are saying so many bad things about this game, it's a really fun simple game, but challenging, the graphics are simple but good
2385	5	a	Nothing to say but good
2386	5	a	Love how small the icons are and how much space it gives.
2387	1	a	The app has been missing cinemas and having issues last couple of months, but now its simply not working. Get a blank screen once opening. The app hasn't been updated since 2015 according to this. Needs to be reviewed and revamped badly.
2388	5	a	I rated 5 stars because it blue😂😂q
2389	1	a	How do you teach if they touch the hand and it says head, or eye and says tummy.
2390	4	a	its a nyc game..but there are very few levels..and it says to purchase the full version of this game..
2391	3	a	But the speaker is not an American, she sounds like a leaner,  but it's okay for beginners,  I mean real beginners only
2392	4	a	this so weird my brother play the game but if I play this game then it ask me for money 20 dollars but my brother like the game then I just deleted the game 😕 but it is a very good game so 4 stars
2393	5	a	Awesome tower defense  game.
2394	3	a	Not a bad game. But wont let me enter my name to submit score. Samsung galaxy s
2395	3	a	I've noticed I can't post to facebook and Twitter at the same time anymore???? Also the widget will not update automatically. Also I can't view my lists anymore?????
2396	1	a	It's freaking slow when I type can you fix this!AND I KEEP CRASHING on Samsung  Galaxy  tab  4
2397	5	a	When you use this app people will get fooled
2398	5	a	I am a non linguistic person  Sweet, I am slowly making progress.  Flashcards are helpful.
2399	5	a	I think it is a good tool for little ones
2400	5	a	Was looking for a mindless time killer, and found a mindless time killer.

2402	1	a	yoo aykho grand kakuhle leweyi plz improve make it zoom clearly
2403	2	a	Why do I need a fb account? Guns not upgrading. When I log in my fb says I'm offline. I like playing single player but I can't get daily rewards or use the higher rewarding refinery. When this first came out it was freaking awesome. I had it on my iPod and my phone. Now u limit it to only social players.sometimes I just have enough time to play one or 2 rounds a day but what's the point if I have to grind and not get rewarded to play daily.
2404	5	a	I like this game because you just drive and I just got my license today I am 24 years old
2405	1	a	אפליקציה גרועה. תמונות קטנות מדי. פרסום מפריע
2406	1	a	The controls are terrible and when the camera moves I can't see where I'm going!
2407	4	a	Just beautiful cool movement and colors
2408	2	a	Unfortunately it randomly fails to reconnect to my phone. It seems like the headset deletes its pairing randomly when it is out of range. Incredibly annoying.
2409	5	a	nice battleship game :), easy to play, great music. i love playing the headshot mode, thanks
2410	3	a	Unable to save progress, unknown words, no rewards, unable to change your \nname,...
2411	1	a	creepy dataleak and password gatharing...
2412	4	a	Love that it requires no special permissions, like reading your contacts or downloading ads. 5 stars if I could have both manual control of brightness and a preset default.
2413	2	a	Graphics are nicely done but gameplay is tired and slow
2414	4	a	It couldn't open in background while using other application
2415	2	a	I like this app but my my malware scanner says it has malware. If any one has any ideas I would appreciate  it.
2416	1	a	I want to uninstall this app and it won't go anywhere , can someone tell me how to am in new york this is no help to me
2417	5	a	This app is awesome. Gives you a lot of information that I didn't even know existed
2418	4	a	Pretty cool tool for comparing various wireless carriers.
2419	5	a	Can somebody help me? I'm stuck on level 26.
2420	3	a	Full of quotes about God and from the Bible and in addition there are ones from Christian sources and ones about Jesus. There are not so many of them.
2421	2	a	Too many files get saved with very small fonts. Difficult to consolidate them and delete the individual files. Stops in between without any information.
2422	5	a	كانت شبكتي ضعيفة مررررة و هسة الشبكة فووول قوية انصح الجميع بالتنزيل و اني فحصته ما فيه فيروسات و مجرب و امن و أؤكد لكم 😉
2423	5	a	Love all the super fast slots. Good daily and hourly bonuses.
2424	5	a	I've been playing the stories for the last year and a half. I've had good ones and bad. But it's still a good game. Just need to do more mini games when you get to higher levels. Not much to do after that but wait for weekly outfit and items and like your neighbors clothes. They also need to have some more clothes and item's to gift with 4 is very boring and getting old. I don't even use them.
2425	3	a	Need to have landscape option! I have a Galaxy View and would take it to another level!
2426	4	a	if it had more wallpapers to chouse from and custome wigets then I'll give 5★
2427	1	a	App got even worst you can't even see your tickets now does anyone even \ntest this stuff? Your better off going to the mobile website than using \nthis app avoid
2428	5	a	Doesnt support 1.9 servers so its not good till then i use to use it, but now i cant i liked it before pretty handy --- alright cool ill set my rating to 5 star now since it will be, and i loved thenformat when i could use it
2429	3	a	It is a gateway to many diff websites hosting the actual e books. It would be nicer if there was a feature where it could just get u the particular book u want. Or when u are not sure of what u want, if you could directly browse a consolidated list, for titles that might interest you.
2430	5	a	New changes are Awesome,Some stn are nt Avl@ur cnrty !pls fix tht also! cheers !fav chnl - classical
2431	5	a	The mechanics and the music are very nice, the graphics are as if you were floating in the galaxy, no ads, you pay only to get randomised new levels to continue enjoy the game.. Really well done.. You can even continue to toy with any level after you finish it for added enjoyment..
2432	5	a	This app is a great pomodoro tool. Works with necessary features and doesn't take too much space on my phone.
2433	4	a	i nid crtfcte instler for my phne.but i dnt knw how.,i already install dis but not work,why?
2434	5	a	Once in the subway i cant seem to go back up the steps. Cross hair's are distracting and arent in 3d so kinda useless. Other than that awesome job! Look forward to more levels.
2435	1	a	It's turning off when I want to take a picture.
2436	5	a	Medic student, makes a great,quick reference,and quick study on the go
2437	5	a	This app is awesome! It works very nicely and is a lot of fun just to mess around with. I highly recommend it if you want to play around with a synth.
2438	4	a	As a new brewer I must say that this app is pretty essential. A good \ncommunity of people ready to help out with any questions you may have. It \ngives you a glimpse of the comradery that exist within this hobby. A good \ngroup of people to be apart of. My only complaint with the app is that the \nsearch feature isn't so good. But other than that it's pretty good. Cheers. \nAnd happy brewing.
2439	5	a	This is the best flashlight so far in the Play Store. Thanks!
2440	4	a	" thus cutting off the app from the drone."""
2441	5	a	It's really good,  just warning others  this is not a game,  it's just a guide for the game.  It mainly just fills your brain with knowledge,  to become badass at this game
2442	5	a	Everything about it is beautiful. My 3 kings will surely love this. Thank you.
2443	5	a	Such an amazing App it has three articles in one, the piano, guitar tuner and a metronome and it saves space.... I love this App
2444	5	a	I've been playing this game off and on since it came, I love it at times and hate it at times( when I lose to lower team w/o them using perks and me using 3 perks lol) but even with that I absolutely love this game especially now that we can control team leader, makes it so awesome!!!
2445	5	a	Its great, Its fun to play around a bit. You should really try it out (^w^)
2446	1	a	I hate this the second I go into the game it frezzes and I can not even play it
2447	1	a	Den nye er tungvint og uoversiktelig. Buggete og treg. Som et glansbilde, fint på fremsiden men ingenting bak.
2448	5	a	One of my favorite games.. Love love love it!!
2449	3	a	Overall, the game is great.  However, when I say tap to buy a blueprint and I do not have enough money, the game does not tell me how much it is. I hit the icon, but no info comes up telling me what I need.
2450	5	a	The app cannot acess SELinux since Android 5.0 update. :/ //Edit// Ok thanks, worked for me :), Great Support :)
2451	1	a	This game is the worst game I ever played, this game sucks and this shouldn't be in google play store!!!!!!!FOR LIFE
2452	2	a	It keeps doing the same thing as the linxs going back to the main menu and showing ads like they don't want me to play I love thouse games upgrade it for like different bosses when they finished
2453	5	a	Found this from twit,  just wish we could do more than simply know which apps are doing it
2454	5	a	I really like the game it is a pretty good racing game...it's actually a challenge so is hillclimbracing
2455	2	a	As I said I can't use, nor activate it Please fix!? Or... Am I being 'Really' Stupid?
2456	5	a	Impressived but too expensive to purchase items like protective gears and weaponary....to make it more challenging every level u played the handouts are a far cry to exchange for our desire items or a suitable suit like weapon \u0026 body gear....pls fix my concerns.many thanks! Gamewise is addictive!
2457	3	a	Seemed great at first, Advance Task Killer is just as good but it's 80% smaller.
2458	3	a	I like the wallpaper designs but every time I want to view or change my background there are pop up Ads.
2459	5	a	I have not played yet but ......well i dunno im just guessing
2460	5	a	It's great nd I can't wait to see what happens next I would love more runes and challenges
2461	1	a	Spy ware ad ware. Waste. Tricks.
2462	4	a	Channel graph needs work. Color of a wifi signal in Yellow is extremely hard to see. Get rid of that color. It is useless. I wish this could securely connect directly to my router so I can run updates, change passwords, change wifi names on the fly. That would be Extremely useful. Hello Netgear, great idea here.
2463	4	a	It worked and helps me relax a little since I'm not far enough along to feel peanut kick so this helps me.... I swear it worked. I also tried it on my daughter (4) and heard her heart beat and myself and heard my heart beat. It works!!  And it helps with the fact that my husband is a truck driver and is only hear on the weekends and can't make the OB apts during the week. So now, when he comes home tonight I can let him hear the real thing instead of me recording it on my phone....love it
2464	3	a	This game is fun and nice. But require lots of mithril. And this app is having problem in my phone. When I restart my phone, moat of the times the application will be gone left the data. Its like application corrupter. After I install this app again then everything is normal until I restart my phone. I am using samsung galaxy s2
2465	4	a	Needs more background and maybe back of cards themes
2466	5	a	This app is great! The registration went smoothly. I got in right away. The payment process took only about 1 minute. My only problem was when I got stuck on the 4-digit year in the expiry date (MM/YYYY) when I was paying using my card. It took me the longest time to figure it out. Thanks for your replying on my last review btw, I really appreciate it. Other than that, I really commend this app for its convenience.
2467	1	a	This game is nòt very good
2468	1	a	Can't log into the app, and when I go through the browser it says no content found. So its useless and has wasted the money I spent on the downloads I wanted to view.
2469	5	a	Unlike the dozens of other dice rollers out there, Dice Bag does an amazing job without all the over-played graphics and foof that munchkins seem to float toward.  Majorly configurable. Clean interface. Simple GUI. Just a very well done job.
2470	5	a	Beautiful app. Lovely transitions between day and night. Buying full version.
2471	3	a	This has been my preferred sudoku app for years, but now it no longer displays both the pencil and normal numpad in landscape mode, making solving puzzles much more time-consuming. I very rarely play it now.
2472	4	a	Hisse grafikleri çok başarısız,  günlük, aylık ve yıllık grafikler eklenmeli
2473	1	a	But I was stuck with the loading screen at 5 out if 6. I got a VR yesterday and I'm so sad this happened.... Please fix
2474	5	a	Works great on my SGS. Installed Fugumod BE with this!
2475	3	a	The game was much better on a console. The graphics are out dated but alright. The controls need to be tuned more for mobile use and I hated how they kept saying they're always hungry
2476	4	a	Pretty cool on free version. Changes places u fly to and from constantly. So if you are like me, you won't get board in an hour with free version. This can only get better with I'm ap purchases.
2477	1	a	Dont download those if you Dont like ads.. Becoz this game has got lots of ads... This game also hangs and dosn't work properly.
2478	5	a	Intuitive, huge font choice, speech bubble options, colors \u0026 shadowing. Everything ALWAYS works! Multiple Android phones.
2479	5	a	This is, so far, the best and easiest of all the event management apps I have seen. Great work. And the best part, the guys behind the scene i.e. the support/help team respond quick.   I would strongly like to recommend this app to the event managers. Forget pen \u0026 paper, use ☑ CheckInEasy
2480	1	a	Was super excited then super disappointed. System used. Win 10, latestest updates. Amd 8 core CPU. 32g ram, ssd drive. Tablet used in usb c. Samsung tab s4. First tried in bluetooth, super lag. The usb c connection. Same results. Pressure sensitivity works. However super lag. I was ready to jump on it and purchase. And recommend. Unfortunately, I cannot.
2481	1	a	Downloaded and installed without noted error, game will not open.
2482	4	a	The app shows a lot of useful info for anyone trying to compare cell carriers. I like that you can zoom in to street level and add layers, like terrain, into the mix. It told me at least part of what I need to know. I was a little disappointed that I can't seem to submit data on my lousy cell service because of my lousy cell service. Keep getting an error about a data network change.
2483	4	a	It's hard getting off of level nine. When I restart that level, the number of flares doesn't start with zero again.
2484	5	a	Its a fun game. But everytime you hit a battler win the game forcloses and you don't get your win
2485	5	a	Japanese text based, so shows up no matter what on Androids.
2486	1	a	"A joke.  Offer zero value vs the web version of Sunny Portal. Takes ages to load. Sometimes just won't load. Hard to believe but SMA took lot of efforts to make it even slower than the web version that is already slow.  Same dated interface as the web version with less informations available. Just the typical example of what an app should not be ... I look forward to each updates expecting improvements. Nop, just making it \work\"" with new SMA devices ..."""

2490	5	a	This fastest way to meet new people
2491	1	a	This app is so awkward to use. The ergonomic considerations are poor.
2492	1	a	This isn't tab mix plus, it does nothing and tends to crash
2493	5	a	Excellent. My mom is easily able to use this.
2494	5	a	Always will I love this game. It is a must play
2495	2	a	I love the game but it won't let me go in it now!

2506	5	a	I love this app.  It is so handy and has saved me a lot of money.
2507	5	a	This app is really awesome as it contains variety of designs and all these designs are easy to draw.
2508	5	a	People that say it sucks ar have horrible taste in music get it if you have a good taste in music.!
2509	1	a	If any one wants to his time waste then you can downloud. It's realy bad game . Developer you are make a very nonsense game .
2510	5	a	I loved the fact that the game was based on a pill head who would get mad when he couldn't find his pills so took it out on the cat, mom, girlfriend and dad I guess haha
2511	5	a	As I  have commented in another review, all of these games are fantastic and I have not found any other hidden object type games that even come close to everything the developer includes in all of the games.  I have played each of the games, and they are all terrific. The animations, art, the in app games, and variety of hidden object scenes are just fantastic.  To the developer,  much thanks for all of your hard work. I would love for you to make more of these games for any other themes you care to. I for one will purchase them all!!!!
2512	3	a	The option that is needed is video recording on the front screen and multi view of camera 📷 this app would be perfect if its upgraded with those features, please consider these upwards.

2520	1	a	The settings screen appears after every time you unlock your phone,  rendering this wallpaper unusable.
2521	1	a	Never got to try it out because it crashed every time I tried to use it. Also too many permissions required including my email address. No thanks.
2522	5	a	I've loved this app every since I was little my grandma would give me her tablet and all I would do is play this game even tough I'm 14 now I still think this game is amazing
2523	4	a	I am a Meteorologist by profession. This app is the simplest, cleanest, no frills radar app that I have been able to find. No toolbars to clutter the screen, just a plain old radar app. It won't give you high res data or anything like Radarscope or Pykl3 would, but you're also not paying 10 bucks for it ;) It's my go-to when I want a simple, broad look at the radar.
2524	5	a	So good app for practice
2525	5	a	Stop trying to make money jst make tht F@##k app free like the other stuff
2526	5	a	This little fella is so cute n cool. I hardly give apps 5 stars but th is one is awesome
2527	1	a	Rate it as a 1 this game takes so long to download
2528	5	a	From starting download to working in less than 2 minutes.  Great app, very easy to use.  I paired with Bluetooth and it was great.  Well written app!

2530	5	a	Good app which tells me what I need to know. Short and sweet
2531	4	a	Like the travel through space look and doesn't take too much battery life. Makes the phone feel more lively.
2532	1	a	It was very good until it blocked and I couldn't make a backup so I lost everything and as pioneer it's a disaster. Sorry, but please help me
2533	5	a	I have been channeling my inner Tangerine Dream on this app. It is hard to lay it down.
2534	1	a	Worst app.. this app is just waste of time, nothing real about the \ninformation it gives
2535	3	a	Needs  to be updated with the number of video we have to insert in the  report
2536	1	a	It takes a really long time to download just for one thing! You click on something and you have to wait forever for it to download and when it's done it turns out it's not what you wanted at least put little picture to show what it would look like before you click on it.
2537	5	a	Same as its name.. Ez
2538	1	a	For some reason everytime I try to connect it keeps giving me an error. If I don't get a reply by 2 hours I will refund it.
2539	4	a	Not enough mlg. Maybe if u get 420 kills some stuff happens. AKA killstreak rewards
2540	5	a	Easy to read text, quick reference to any passage.  Choice of reader voice and ability to slow down the reader in the option to listen would be nice.  Also the ability to automatically mark, in order to pick up where I left off for both read and listen options separately would be nice.  Never the less,  I appreciate this application.
2541	1	a	Needs access to photos media and files to work. This is unnecessary access requirement for this type of app.
2542	4	a	You definitely have to know some French to use it but it is fun if you do. I have enjoyed the challenge.
2543	1	a	Game not good because this stop in use that's to bad
2544	5	a	Sharp graphics, easy but challenging levels, so... Just a very good thing to have ;-)

2550	3	a	I would really love this one if it wasn't for the ridiculous number of ads and I've played most of the logo games.
2551	1	a	Jeg forstår ikke helt hva jeg skal bruke den til?!
2552	4	a	I like this game. It is very addicting \u0026 it passes the time. Yes, I paid for it and I still have to close the ad at start up,  but I honestly didn't think much of it until I read some of the reviews here. It's really not a big deal tip me. The only issue I have is that I'm struggling to pass a certain level. Almost to the point of giving up!
2553	5	a	It would be nice if it would beep again if you have exceeded the set speed limit for a excessive amount of time.
2554	3	a	Its ok but the real thing is bad
2555	5	a	So I have a rooted Verizon note 3. I use custom Rom so I confirmed with this app that I was vulnerable. Installed the fix that is on xda forums. Ran app again, no longer vulnerable. Thank you lookout. I use your regular anti virus app too.
2556	5	a	Game is very good and entertaining

2559	4	a	I never thought playing minimalistic golf would be so satisfying. This game is a great time killer for when you want to play something calm and relaxing. The minimal colors, design and sound really wrap up the experience. Although it's not quite 5 stars because I feel the game is lacking a few things such as the option to zoom in and out, and rotate around the map. All in all, great game.
2560	1	a	Cannot setup due to this error. Unusable. Galaxy S6 Lollipop
2561	5	a	I personally enjoyed the game. It was great. Every second was worth it. The game was challenging at very single stage and it was awsome. The stages weren't that little but still they weren't that much either. I recommend the game to every one who likes thinking and is ready to retry every single level until it's done. I hope to see more updates which will add more levels and probably multiplayer, which will be awsome. Please do it, I beg you. And just to remind you i love the game, please continue it.
2562	4	a	It would be better if theres new stages and bosses that you can fight and a multiplayer so that you can play with your friends just 4 stars for know.

2567	1	a	Yo, zetten jullie App2SD nog ff aan? Dan kan ik de rating aanpassen. Voor de rest ziet het er 'handig' uit...
2568	3	a	It's great, however I didn't give it 5 stars because I wish the quizzes at the end of the sections would give steps on how to get to the answer rather than just giving answer. Also, the the second section on electromagnetism has bugs. When I try to open a section no words pop up, just a blank screen with the calculators down the page. Disappointing.
2569	1	a	Won't let me log in. Try the forgot password and it says I'm not registered. Try to create account and it says account already taken. Fix immediately or I demand a refund. 😬
2570	5	a	I'm no expert but this app oozes quality. Downloaded it for my 4 yr old son who has become intrigued by the human body. Great graphics and intuitive controls. A visual feast on the nexus 10.

2583	2	a	Landscape only. Dumb idea. I like the regular Glympse app.
2584	5	a	It's nice but better not to download it
2585	5	a	This is the best game ever so all those people who say it's rubish just shut up.😌
2586	5	a	At first i thought it was going to be rubbish. I was wrong. I thought the semi transparent notification bar is going to annoy me but it didn't. I like how the stock keyboard turns to a ics one. I like how ( I think) there is more blue than in the cyanbread theme. Perfect
2587	3	a	I think this one is the most epic app solution for my box cloud music needs. But i have problem playing m4a files through the music player. Please developers if you can read this i hope you can give solution to it asap. Because i think thiss app has a great future! More power for you all!

Totally screws up the accuracy of my last.fm account. Also left \nanother review and the developer replied, but the email address provided on \nthe play store page for this app is INVALID. So I tried to reply to get \nsome sort of a resolution to this problem and couldn't. This is my ONLY \nOPTION.
2611	1	a	Not worth downloading just sits there not worth the data
2612	5	a	Beautiful graphics, really very addicting game. I think im living back in my childhood. Superb funny game for children. Thanks ;)
2613	4	a	It's a great app. I just hard for me to move around on the game. I suppose it's like exploration lite apart from you can save your things you've made!
2614	5	a	Downloaded it via a 3G Data Card MTNL Jadoo  and it installed on my 1st Teracom MTNL  Tablet PC. It has everything I need. It works offline also. No need for a always on net connect. Search results are very accurate with regards to network provider, State, but not accurate on the city. For Ex I entered a UP east Siddarth Nagar City mobile # and it showed UP East and Network operator correctly but city it showed as Banaras.  But still OK for and gets the job done!  Colonel Zaysen
2615	5	a	I love to see when a product comes along which demands thought from the user and the creator, and blipblup does this and much more. Elegant, challenging, and fun blipblup is a gem of an app game and deserves all the praise it's given.
2616	5	a	I love this game.Alot of other tycoon games are hard and ppl dont understand but this one is rlly good
2617	5	a	I installed this app to comment on how awesome the dev is, great app and good job sticking it to the idiots. Oh and my bmi dropped 5 points from the last time I checked, I dont think the app did anything about it could have been the stomach worms I got from eating a space egg salad. App works perfectly thanks
2618	4	a	The update made the app so much better. But one thing that bothers me is that when you recieve a notification and then click on it the app just takes forever to load the specific town or place and times that you wanna see. So please (my name a) Jeff can you fix it. Thanks bra.

2626	5	a	Does what it says on the label! Simple but brilliant, I can't put it down!!
2627	2	a	Great idea, shame about the bugs. App is pretty much unusable. I haven't seen anything this bad EVER.  Added a second camera and now can't view either on mobile.  Removed one and can see the other again.    Have to have sensitivity set to 10 to get cameras to sense movement. One camera can't have audio on due to noisy feedback possibly from inside the camera.  And for goodness sake, I've paid £149 for a camera, do you really need to fill the mobile app with adverts for cameras... especially when they pop up, cover the  video feed and then stay there. D'uh!  Come on, get this app fixed!
2628	4	a	I like the game. Intuitive controls and good graphics. I would have thought it would give a random new puzzle but it does not. It instead has preloaded puzzles and it remembers your attempts. The game also gives trophies for each completed puzzle. There are 480 puzzles on each level (easy, medium, hard) so once I finish them all, I wonder what happens...? Because I can not replay a puzzle. Trying to replay a puzzle just shows your previous solution.  Once you finish a puzzle, you view an ad.

2636	1	a	I think it is a dustbin it is not like a guitar
2637	5	a	I thought your last game (Ice) was a very addicting game, but after playing this it changed how I saw it. It is very addicting trying to tap those square as they grew faster every second. I felt like those squares where conniving with one another, plotting to take my life through a seizure. Haha, it was great. As it went along I got better making me feel kind of vainglorious. Then I died! Then I played again.

2648	5	a	This app contains better content, with a better design and a better execution than most premium math apps. It is easily worth paying for and more than the usual starting point app fee. The fact that it is ad free is an additional bonus. Great stuff.
2649	1	a	Looks like someone did a tutorial on how to inject adverts into a game... Then forgot to actually code anything like a game

2651	4	a	Big Fan of Leisure Suit Larry. But this one is alright.. i guess. Wish it revealed more of the girls like in other Leisure Suit Larry Games. This one is a tap and interact game, wich at times can be a bit frustrating trying to find what you need. The alleys are not as interactive as in three other games and usually end up getting you beaten up here pretty quick. I don't see how people complain allot the game controls as they work fine for me. But this isn't a true Leisure Suit Larry, because if censorship it contains. Mature suggestive themes, some exotic scenes, but it's not what I expected. But still a good game to kill time, and take a look at some pretty girls.
2652	3	a	Works well. I only get the standard map, others (IFR,VFR) don't work. Trails on the aircraft would be nice, as would colours for altitude.

2656	1	a	This app will not work on any of my android devices. Funny how it works flawlessly on apple products. So if you have an IPad the Service is fine, any android (phone or tablet) and I would consider a different cloud service. Not to mention that the app hasn't been updated in over 2 years.
2657	3	a	After playing this game for a little while it goes to loading and stays there pls fix.
2658	1	a	Froze on the glitch screen home button disappeared and there is no way out.

2662	2	a	The main page for the app always comes up for my Instagram app. It'd be nice to use my separate apps well separately.

2672	4	a	With th way the game is, the only good place on th screen t tap is at the bottom. So u can see the path ur going. The only problem is there's an ad, right where the perfect place to tap is. I mean there's already enough ads as it is. The ads for diamonds thing was a nice touch.
2673	3	a	I cant apply this theme on my google play music...help me out..plZ!
2674	3	a	I'm not sure how accurately it works or how it's supposed to work! So, here it goes☺!      I was in Redmond Washington and my apps either didn't work or very slowly☹. I live in Ware Massachusetts and my apps work wonderful!      Hopefully this is helpful!
2675	1	a	Pero karun nana may bayad. Maytag ibalik ni ninyo ug libre, gamit unta kaayo very informative. Tanan news sa Internet libre. Except ani.
2676	1	a	مو راضي يشتغل مع انه حملت العربي ودخلت ع الخصائص .. وحاولت اختار اللغة بس كل اللغات طلعت الا العربي
2677	1	a	Dumbest app. Downloaded only for credits on pet salon.
2678	5	a	Super app. I love it.
2679	5	a	Brilliant for teaching children all about your body n how it works
2680	5	a	Ive use it for almost 2 hour strait and didnt get invaded it is a great app. IT WORKS
2681	5	a	Really earned a lot free balance and also won the app contest and got 100...
2682	5	a	This app is very helpful.... I would have failed in my semester exams without it... 😊
2683	1	a	I uninstalled after first use, found websites that are much clearer and do a better job
2684	1	a	It supposed to have rows so you can write on it.. there's no rows, copy, paste.. just like a kids doodle \u0026 paint! please fix like it used to be.. help!!
2685	5	a	I don't understand about this app it's not coming on home screen
2686	5	a	I saw the plane above my area
2687	1	a	"Frick this game! Hate it so much I wanna kill the creator... people must have pretty boring lives if they always wanna play this crap. It does not even work, it won't let me tap the \food\"" then the fat idiotic moose does not eat it. FIX IT FATTIES!!"""
2688	1	a	"Not sure what to say. I bought one single book distributed with Gumroad, and the app will quickly download the file for it and proceed to do... Nothing. Just spins there saying \Downloading\"" even though the file transfer was incredibly fast on my connection. This app for displaying written media has critically failed at its one and *only* job. I can't rate it more than 1 star until this changes."""
2689	4	a	Dear Developer greetings!! why have you not added the feature for the app to read directly from messages... that would have made the app complete....
2690	5	a	I love this game because it keeps our  real hunting strong
2691	5	a	Nice design n funny apps.
2692	5	a	Surprised not more people are playing this game. Recomend.
2693	5	a	its so good .. I really love it , mybe \u003d￣ω￣\u003d
2694	2	a	I'm using it and randomly my phone tries to go the appstore. There aren't \neven adds, it just goes to some page automatically. The typing is alright \nbut it acts a little worse than normal typing somehow. The only reason I \nwent with this one was because the better ones asked for too much access \nthan a notepad needs
2695	1	a	Terribly unstable, constantly crashes which is unfortunate as it would be a great game. Uninstalling to avoid further frustration and disappointment.
2696	2	a	Seemed good at first but then became quite buggy. Quite a few images don't \nload.
2697	5	a	Simple and cute game, loved it
2698	2	a	I used to play this game on Motorola Xoom before, now I want to play it on my s6 edge and it just crashes every time I try opening it
2699	1	a	I download this app but it doesn't work in galaxy s3.
2700	4	a	Cool but nt as aspected.
2701	1	a	Please can i download this game yawa ka
2702	4	a	Şuan yüklüyorum inşallah 15 kilo veririm
2703	1	a	I have to give a poor rating because the developer has chosen to make dozens of add-on apps which wastes our space. Plus a Pro and a Plus version you must buy both to get basic features.
2704	1	a	Let me try this one and hope it will work..I luv this  theme but it doesn't work.. pls fix!
2705	4	a	Like alot of reviews have said,  the beginning 30 to 45 mins of play time is slow. But once you start upgrading weapons and skills you can see where and how the game becomes enjoyable.
2706	5	a	My brother and I love this game! It is so entertaining when we don't have anything else to do.
2707	5	a	به نظر من بهترین برنامه برای ساعات اذان هست  خداعجرتان بدهد
2708	3	a	I don't understand the whole character unlocking system. If it were easier that would be great.
2709	3	a	I love the version of this app that I have on my laptop- I can backup restore delete etc. However with thrle android app I can only backup and see lists of what has bn backed up. I would love to see thumbnails of the pic so I can choose which to restore and I wud love to reatore what I choose to. Can someone pls help me?
2710	5	a	Looks cool so far I like it.
2711	5	a	This game won't drive grandma crazy trying to get past the ads while she's babysitting.
2712	1	a	Why isn't the smart drive updating? I've done a few trips with my location on but no results show....
2713	5	a	Awesome app! It's come to my aid so many times this pregnancy, especially with me being a FTM, and kept me from calling my OB for every little thing.
2714	3	a	All swiping on the screen made me a little bit a tired and I was not able to focus on the game because of constant swiping on screen. Make it with gyro control and send me a request to test the game please.
2715	5	a	Very handy to have this information on my mobile phone. Thank you!
2716	1	a	Really boring.all the same enemies and only you only fire an arrow
2717	4	a	I found this game frustrating at first because of the hint button, but began to enjoy it, although not much of a storyline. Worth playing
2718	1	a	Free in google play till you try and apply the skin..  then you get a screen charging you 2.99.
2719	4	a	Please add new questions it is so boring now and also please send the challenges who are actively playing
2720	5	a	Very good, I like it very much 👍
2721	1	a	The only button that worked was update. So I did and still  nothing. Big scam. Took my money nothing in return.
2722	1	a	It gives you a completely different frame that you didn't even pick
2723	5	a	The most comprehensive one.. good job
2724	5	a	This is the best game I've played so far! Please create more of these games!
2725	2	a	Clunky, old fashioned, crashed every time I scanned something, wouldn't sync with Samsung health.  It had lots of good things, such a shame I couldn't get it to work for me
2726	1	a	It does not works. I click on the network generated by the D-Link 503A and it keeps loading and loading and show me a message: check your device and try again. It never opens the setting page.
2727	4	a	I love everything about the game except the adverts and to few levels, please make new levels, or perhaps even an in game level creator option! :)
2728	2	a	It doesn't keep the screen awake and there is no setting for it. It might just be me but it seems to go back and resync to the time server 5 or 6 seconds before the top of the minute which doesn't do me any good if I'm setting a mechanical watch. Otherwise it works great for the 30 seconds before the screen turns off.
2729	1	a	Sucks it lags so much don't get this app.
2730	1	a	does not even deserve 1 star you dont see it explode
2731	3	a	I switched to Vonnage for the same low price ($9.90 per month) and recomend you do too.  1. Callcentric does not offer phone support, vonnage does.  2. Callcentric does not offer a device, you need to contact grandstreem or who ever, buy a device for $200, pay $300 to configure and ship, monthly maintainance fees on top, vonnage this is all free.   If you have callcentric I recommend you contact vonnage and have your number ported to them.
2732	5	a	i love it i cried whem i got this my cousin died 4 days before my birthday and christmas this year, this will always remind me of heaven, Jesus Christ and my family that died befoe i was born.
2733	3	a	This is a brilliant game and I am enjoying the dialog very much. The \nproblem is the sound is unstable every time I play the game after not \nplaying for a few hours. I have to close it and clear the cache then it \nworks fine. Could this be an issue that is fixable? Then I could give it a \n5 star rating.
2734	1	a	Kairosoft used to make awesome games but apparently they no longer update them to work on current devices.  I tried three different ones and all are unbearably slow and freeze up constantly.  So I guess they dgaf about all the people who paid a big fiver for their crap games.  Had they priced them better I'm sure more people would've purchased them.  GREED SUCKS.
2735	5	a	Love is better than feel
2736	5	a	Many alarm sounds I've found before are too short.
2737	5	a	Nice graphics and everything. And I love the style of artwork
2738	4	a	I chose the Man Bands category and it asked me which member of take that is in their 30s. Now I'm a big fan of take that, so I know their ages,and it said that Robbie was the one in his 30s! Robbie is now 40 or something and I lose all my money because of it! Also,nhjes no longer in take that..? UODAT SOME QUESTIONS!
2739	4	a	Now I am set, thanks!
2740	1	a	Same as the rest, install plug in message keeps popping up. And the I have selected one character but it comes out to be a other
2741	5	a	I have 2 different colored eyes and this is great  test out different colors to but colored prescription contact lenses.
2742	5	a	ITS THE BEST GAME OUT OF ALL TIMES. BETTER THAN 1 AND 2 AND I FOUND OUT ON MY OWN PHANTOM FREDDY IS REALLY GOLDEN FREDDY.  yes i know there only springtrap can kill you but its alittle scarer in a way to me.I cant wait for fnaf 4 THANKS SCOTT IF YOU READ THIS.
2743	5	a	Its a really good game with smooth graphics ,its just needs a den and make the dog run faster  and pls add thirst and ability to drink
2744	5	a	These wallpapers r so AWESOME!!!
2745	5	a	Anyone who doesn't give this app 5 stars is an idiot. Almost as dumb as the guy who decided it would be good to remove the call log button in the first place. does EXACTLY what it says, now I have a call log button.
2746	1	a	My 30 secs video become 7 secs video. It's lagging and suddenly become fast video i can't do anything with this app 😭
2747	2	a	Takes forever to make money
2748	1	a	Cheio de propagandas e trava tudo, tem que entrar no Facebook e Twitter para assistir, horrível mesmo
2749	5	a	Great way to turn the clock back. Displays well on my tablet, and best played with a stylus or pen.
2750	1	a	Can't even play a single presentatation..
2751	5	a	I also think that asus created thier theme for girls only there is nothing for boy
2752	3	a	Its okay but needs to add itunes apps like something like that but keep up the good work
2753	3	a	Great app but... I dislike how if I put in a shift working Sunday night through to Monday the Monday section is included in the previous week. As a night shift worker it would be great if once it hit midnight Monday morning those hours will count towards the start of the week if I've selected Monday as the beginning of my week. It sucks because I don't want to have to put in 2 seperate shifts every time I work a Sunday to Monday.. yknow? This is the only problem so far, otherwise it's amazing!
2754	2	a	if only it was like the sony ericsson one
2755	3	a	It isn't the best Game I have EVER played but it's OK.
2756	3	a	Its ok but could be better
2757	4	a	Everything is fine but the fact that there's no live data transfer status to check or monitor of what's being copied or how much is remaining. Which will eventually make you to miss or delete a file accidentally.  It has happened to me twice.
2758	5	a	Runs really slow on my phone but you you have the best emulator I've seen in the Google store you should make a Snes emulator that would be awesome I would totally buy that great job by the way keep it up with the updates!
2759	2	a	It doesn't save photos. Used to be great on the S4. Can you please adapt it to work without sd card?
2760	1	a	Screwing up the game every time you tap your screen. Not worth even sampling with this much trouble.
2761	4	a	How do I edit rename on sd card. It does not work. I recommend the app. It is easy to use. Trims and merges video. It needs permission to rename files on SD card. How
2762	1	a	The app was great now there are so many full page adds that pop up every 2-3 pages the app is pretty much useless and the worst part some adds continue to popup after closing the app. Hate it now.
2763	5	a	Would like to see an ad free version.
2764	4	a	Pity the keyboard gets in the way so much. Bit annoying.  Great app though,  use it a lot
2765	2	a	Been a user for years, but way too many ads. Seriously considering uninstalling it. Edit: slightly better, no crazy pop-ups, but an ad every 3 or 4 reports is still too many. Can't we have a paid version at least? Edit 2: over a year later and still the same. Again, I don't mind paying for an ad free version.
2766	4	a	Would give 5 stars if it continued to play in the background when minimised. I want to be able to use this app and surf the Web for guitar tab at the same time! Otherwise, faultless!
2767	5	a	Just love those categorised vocabularies given in the app, really do useful to me, the easy examples of sentences oh really love such dictionary, by the way hangman game is just a waste of time, disliked it. Overall great to learn English meanings
2768	1	a	Plus swords need faster attack
2769	5	a	Cant wait to show this game to my little bro
2770	2	a	App crashes while launching. Unable to use it.
2771	3	a	i really like this app bt i would like to request d developer to kindly update the plugin coz this plugin crashes for fones running android 4.4 and above...thank you
2772	4	a	If the images were clearer would give 5 stars.
2773	5	a	I love this game 🎮 it is 5 star 🌟 ya!!! And it is real funny if some on dose not like it then why are you saying bad stuff about this game this game is boss i will rate it E for everyone. Plz make another one☺
2774	1	a	This app most be made by kids in the first programming lesson.  Do not use time on this, there are many more better apps out there.
2775	5	a	Great game. Live to play all three levels. Good for the mind. Have to look to find objects on some levels.
2776	4	a	Would be soo much better if it didn't start at the beginning when you reopen, start were you left off when you closed app
2777	5	a	Progresezi la cunostintele generale  .
2778	4	a	I like this wallpaper. The flames are the best but it sometimes crashes the ui of my s4. Pls fix this.
2779	5	a	Its fun and entertaing to playbi live this game
2780	3	a	Looks like a very useful app, I really wish it would cover NSW now that the EmergencyAus app is no longer. Would happily pay for this app if it covered NSW. Functions great and easy to navigate. Please consider expanding your coverage area!
2781	5	a	Best application not waste 500 kb
2782	1	a	Clicked on the circle, it told me it was a diamond. Not a very useful app. Trash.
2783	1	a	I'm a programmer. with this crap can't draw a line.  Why it's called GATT I don't know.
2784	5	a	I have never had any problems with this great game.
2785	1	a	I does anyone know how to fix this app it wont even load all the way it jut \nis a white blank screen I mean it's a waste of space on my phone anyone \nhave any ideas before I trach it?
2786	5	a	Ive been glued to game. This game brought back a lot of my childhood. There is one thing i never allowed playing growing up is that once a player passes, that that player stays out until a new round. Once you pass, you wait. But thiss game its different  in a cheating kinda way. Thats gotta go
2787	4	a	It's simple and just what I need. I can store all the words I know. Two pieces of feedback 1. The ability to move cards to other lists, as my lists get bigger I like to split them into multiple lists. 2. Auto font size so text fits in cards well. Thanks
2788	5	a	I was very impressed about not only the local offers but how quickly my rebate was sent directly to PayPal. Thank-you!
2789	3	a	Please support 24CH, 32CH dvr thanks
2790	5	a	So beautiful bear i love it
2791	4	a	This app is really great for on-the-go usage, especially for a student like me who likes to write on the side. I can use it without bringing out my writing notebook and pen, it's portable, and the professor barely notices me. Only problem is I can't quite figure out how to use the bold, italic, headers, etc things. Maybe there should be another pre-installed document for how to use those features. Or maybe it's just me who can't figure it out.
2792	3	a	Well done! Thanks for made this app and it is really useful for student like us. But can you also make it easy, let say it can scanning the text instead of typing. It'll be easier. Over all, it's great  :)
2793	3	a	old versions with all categories stopped working, seen this version on my tv box not worth the data to dl it. try google search.
2794	5	a	Simple to use,accurate. Works well.
2795	1	a	Tried 7 times. Got answer to be instaled, but latter do not appear the butten to open. I could not install this.  Sad !
2796	4	a	I liked the app but where can I download it?  And I have some problems with the music player
2797	5	a	This is the best app ...thumps up
2798	5	a	My daughter has all the baby hazle games and she loves them
2799	1	a	No funciona ni a pedales.
2800	5	a	I bought EVERY single item you can get with xplodium on my iPhone 3GS, and now I have to start completely over. Please fix! I don't want to start over but I don't want to stop playing this either. I only just got the infinity armor too...
2801	1	a	Good game however I paid for the Anniversary Pack a few months ago but it's now telling me to pay to unlock. I emailed through the contact us for answers and still have no reply.  It's July 2017 and i've now lost all previous games that i had with other players and now all the games I bought gone. Emailed 'support' and got no response.  Very pissed off and no one will respond or reinstate my question access.
2802	4	a	its a cool and nice game is very interesting is hard but good I recommend
2803	5	a	طبیعت در همه حال و همه نگاه جای عرفانی دارد
2804	4	a	It's a great little mind teaser .. this app just needs a counter for number of pushes and number of moves so I can challenge myself a bit more for each level :)
2805	3	a	hoping it will not kill my battery.but Hearts?omg.i will surely love this
2806	5	a	This  game is the  best ever
2807	5	a	Could you make a game simalar to this, exept with dragons? Please reply
2808	1	a	I can't find any wallpapers because there is way too many ads😒
2809	4	a	A single page app,  no settings.  on/off switch. works like all other apps but requires only camera permissions. cluttered with ads.
2810	4	a	Looks good not quite apple but one of the closest so far. If your having issues seeing your typing your using inverted . like PAC ROM has option for inverted apps... Black or white. Need to have a white text back ground to start . thanks for free ap
2811	5	a	Excellent start! Thank you also for making this available for free for the blind. I hope that the range of objects that can be reliably identified in daily living situations will broaden in due course: use the Teradeep neural network? It would be nice to have an option to turn vibration off, because it does not add anything to the already confidence-thresholded speech feedback.
2812	4	a	First off--this is a fantastic solution and have already recommended it to a friend who also installed it.  In the spirit of honest feedback here I go:  1.) While I do see the benefit of including the webpage title, sometimes I just want to share the link by itself. Certain apps I use automatically parse the link and generates the title and/or thumbnail - its getting somewhat tedious having to delete it each time in these cases.    2.) Similar to #1 the '--via Flynx' bit can also go away...especially after I already paid for it.   3.) Due to the placement of the sharing icon, it's really easy to throw out a link when minimizing the app.  Thank you for for the great product!
2813	5	a	I swear I was going to switch to ios because though their system is closed they have high privacy settings without much user input. Now this app has restored power back to the user despite android being controlled by Google. Thanks a lot!
2814	5	a	Beautiful.!! Love it. Thank you
2815	1	a	Download on HTC DNA, game only shows on half screen can't start game without pressing add. DELETED too bad it looked fun
2816	5	a	I love it so so sooooo much even if a lot of it you have to have pro.
2817	5	a	ive played star traders and found this game... like star traders this game is awsome but it really lacks exploration in the lite version.. the only accessible part was the rueslands territory... if you select other teams youll end up working for ruesland cuz its the only team accessible
2818	5	a	Great way to make urphone stand out from the rest
2819	5	a	They are pictures, but are easy to send and are very very delightful. Finally, a chance to send something that is familiar to ones own race. It matters and was a great gesture to create. I'm personally proud to use these and grateful to have them available. Fantastic work!
2820	2	a	After taking photos, they are aligned upside down.
2821	5	a	GTEAT game. Better than original Yahtzee!! No bugs, just LOTS of FUN!! Thank you 4 the FREE game.
2822	3	a	Worked on EMUI 8.1 but hangs on EMUI 9.0. App was working fine on Huawei P20 Pro on Android 8.1 but since upgrade to released Android 9 Pie, the App hangs on startup. Not helpful for my SmartDrive scores.
2823	1	a	More adverts as anything else! Worst app ever I had!
2824	3	a	i really have fun playing this. i just wish it didnt have bugs that much :) i guess u still have a lot to work on .
2825	5	a	It's rare for people to only see black and white some see colors as a different color than normal eye sight. Color blind people may see blue green red or black instead or yellow or something like that.
2826	4	a	I think its better to put quick attack and to appoint the setter and spiker. Put some combination play also and add libero. In the challenge part, put some choices where we want to challenge something like the antenna, line ball or check ball. Show where the point came from after a single point is played like, block point, spike, ace and an error. Lastly show the best blocker, best spiker and best server after the championship. In that way the game will be more realistic. Anyway, the app is good and it improves a lot. Just Love it.
2827	5	a	Fix it where you cant kill each other
2828	5	a	No ads. Exit button to kill itself. Plenty of useful information about your phone. If option for context sensitive help can be provided, even a short one with links to the exact website content for further understanding, this would be perfect. As it stands now, it is still a great app.
2829	3	a	Crashes on ics on HTC sensation.
2830	2	a	Application is not stable. SMS fees incured and deducted from account.
2831	1	a	This app is horrible don't waste your time! All it does is make your phone vibrate and that's it.
2832	5	a	Also pls make new app like dungeon finder or mineshaft finder :D
2833	4	a	Good game but I have to keep taping for more speed
2834	5	a	Great app. Keep up the good work!
2835	5	a	Chloe me too but I started playing when I was 4
2836	5	a	nice work keep it up
2837	5	a	Pretty cute. I do wish it was easier to read the text though
2838	1	a	It gliched and it just odo stopep
2839	5	a	it is a good game
2840	1	a	It keeps asking me turn on location services even when it's turned on. No use. My location is getting detected in google maps and other apps which use GPS.
2841	1	a	Thay are theif...  Thay are showing 300 minutes while we talk only 170 minutes.....
2842	5	a	It helped a lot .. I didn't have the book or nothing!
2843	4	a	Most recent update fixed an issue on Google Pixel 1 where the App crashed when I tried to take a photo. It works perfectly now and enjoy using the app occasionally.
2844	1	a	Não consigo,  sequer,  ver os meus cartões. .rebenta sistematicamente. ..Android, se ajudar algo.
2845	5	a	Am still here and will  always  be anywhere...  I love always and forever and ever and ever And and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever
2846	5	a	It looks lovely it looks lovely
2847	5	a	GUJARATI     RECIPES
2848	5	a	I like  it's because it  so scary
2849	4	a	The game is very good, and it's a shame more people don't play it.
2850	5	a	Recent updates make this app better and better.
2851	2	a	But I have some complaints, the games tends to lag, I'll be going a steady speed and all of a sudden the game stops and makes me miss when I know for sure my next move was correct. Next, is the game force closes on me while I am playing. Its very disappointing when I have a high score such as 600 or so and the game says white tile is not responding and my score is completely gone. Please fix this issue and I'll give it five stars.
2852	5	a	Nice game a must try archery
2853	1	a	1. When you send someone a message it only display question marks to the receiver. 2. Letter GEIM etc doesn't change shape when it's in the middle.3 you have to change keyboard from setting, rather than simple button on the keyboard.4. They should do spell-check or let others help them
2854	5	a	Message and email notifications caught me off guard and woke the wife. This solves that problem. Set up and forget, excellent.
2855	5	a	I rating it 5 stars because the game is good.but please change it into english
2856	4	a	Klo bisa tol jabotabek kena coverage semuanya (klo ada cctv nya)
2857	1	a	It is boring I thought I can stretch with my finger but there are options no I don't like it
2858	5	a	Great app. Very interesting to read and opens ur mind up to a new way of thinkin! Wud recommend this download
2859	4	a	It does not use your battery. And it is not a battery saver. It just do what it says.
2860	5	a	What most people don't understand about this game is that the graphics are meant to be like this... the game creators want us to feel how the old games felt... this game is Legendary
2861	1	a	The Lazer don't  even come out  of  the  camera  😖😖😖
2862	2	a	3d Virtual Tabletop looks good.   But $12 a year is outrageously expensive for this kind of tool. I don't mind buying an app but there are cheaper solutions.  It is also missing key features that even free apps have. Pass.
2863	3	a	Please make more locations for the free version and more cars. Make the location bigger and remove the handbrake because its not good.
2864	1	a	I would like if you add more cars and things to do
2865	2	a	F this game😒 I'm out
2866	4	a	Really love the game,  won't uninstall it Cruz it's awesome  but it does keep closing down on me.
2867	5	a	I so much like it! 😁
2868	1	a	Over half the words they give you are not accepted in the Wordfued game and is very irritating
2869	3	a	Its a bit annoying though because it keeps failing.... its a shame because some radios dont actualy work its just silence. But appart from that its fine
2870	1	a	I just smashed all the mission  from one to 20 and all it said was go through  them again, just to make sure the enmies don't come back, lol that's so lame
2871	1	a	No ENG. Cannot kill process. Uninstall.
2872	3	a	It's a problem with whatsapp, not this app.. I have two suggestions: 1. Allow pic selection through the other gallery apps too. 2. Allow selection of a pic more than once in the gif.
2873	5	a	Vera level😍voice 👌 worth for having in app list😘😘sivapuranam
2874	4	a	but it takes too much time in makin money......Moreover the workers are very expensive....
2875	5	a	This game is cool I didn't know it wss this good   Love yall hope u comment below bye bye
2876	1	a	So bad game is this how can you say that it is very good game so boring \ngame oh my god I am never seen the game like this
2877	5	a	Best Finska scoring app on android or iOS.
2878	5	a	The icon to start the app is not shown in the phone every time I have to go to the playstore to start the app what to do please help
2879	3	a	Update the turns the steering is bad
2880	3	a	The puzzles are better than some others.  Too many ads.
2881	5	a	The only one i ever use
2882	4	a	Great way to exercise your brain. I LOVE games that require me to think! I only wish there was a way to correct the mistake of accidentally jumping ahead to the wrong line. You can never go back to the skipped line.
2883	1	a	This game use to play flawless now days won't connect fix it and I'll change my review.. Useless game now
2884	5	a	The Perfect App! I tried 4-5 Apps for managing my contact list but THIS APP did exactly what I wanted... The developer Team deserve the *****5 Star*****.
2885	5	a	This game remind me of my childhood. Every year for Xmas my mom would get us a board game. When I was about 10 (maybe less...) She got us the master mind.... playing this game on my phone now help me to relax de escape from my duties a little.
2886	5	a	It's a great tool for kids \u0026 adults too. Kids get more encouraged to brush their teeth when they have a timer like this one. Thanks!!!.
2887	5	a	This app works very we'll, also it doesn't ask for permission to access all of your network information,
2888	5	a	It is very nice but we cannot complete after 3 stages
2889	3	a	Battery problems. Disappointing. Also, with Oreo, disconnected one too many \ntimes.
2890	2	a	Ok I guess. lame though.
2891	1	a	Cripple ware.(limited funtuality) Untill tou pay
2892	5	a	This is the best app I've ever installed, seriously you can access  it from any where in the house,  in any room. I would easily give it 10 stars. Because sometimes the other Remote doesn't always work,  I thought about purchasing another one, but don't need it now.  Awesome app! !
2893	5	a	Mr bullet is best app good work
2894	5	a	Just download this app. I will start tomorrow.
2895	4	a	I love this game but it sucks that's there'd only limited free games and only 1 set you can do a day
2896	1	a	When i try to shoot the game keep on crashing pls fix it
2897	3	a	This app as potiental, it's relaxing even if the blokes voice is alittle annoying. but it's incredibly frustrating with your listening to the mediation and reading the words when  suddenly it stops because an advert as popped up, Because of this  you cannot finished the mediation because it's stop midway through.Then to make matters worse  the only option u have left  is to restart. Please sort.
2898	4	a	an option to add your own pictures or transparent png would be good. might get 5 stars rating from me..
2899	1	a	Was a great game until I purchased it. Then it only would open a half screen. I had to uninstall and reinstall to try to make it work. Freezing my smartphone and not working properly at all. C'mon guys,  you can do better than this.
2900	2	a	The game dose what it wants to
2901	5	a	I love this game but their is something difficult so I ♥it
2902	1	a	This Tim today there is a hacker , everyone played and I exit the game and came back Jesse And Baby Jesse hacked my game and it change they said that change the name but I say no she won't stop I want to say that banned all the HACKERS pls.!
2903	5	a	This app helps me keep tab of all my monthly spends. A quick glance at the summary let's me know where I have over spend.  Good start if you are interested in a disciplined way to start saving money.
2904	3	a	Lovely wallpaper with rich colourful graphics, and non distracting live graphics. Only downside is that it frequently crashes. Please fix to get 5 stars
2905	2	a	Please update this app, it has some problems with android 8.1
2906	1	a	Keeps cutting out on galaxy s.rubbish.shame coz like the game
2907	5	a	缺钱的话 ，只要输入 EKbdYA 这个邀请码可以得到 5000 币哦。 😁
2908	5	a	This is a fun game to be honest most games close out or never work I give this 5 stars good job but keep updating
2909	5	a	Never seen such a wonderfull game
2910	3	a	Turned off by the app almost immediately just because the text is all jumbled when viewing the feed
2911	4	a	I used it to flag girls on the highway and ask for numbers.. works great for me!
2912	2	a	The wallpaper looks very nice, but after a few minutes of using it the wallpaper just crashed and keeps crashing. Or if it does not crash the wallpaper is just black.
2913	5	a	It helps me lot, exalent to take selfi photos thanks to the team
2914	4	a	This good a little to easy if you click on the cheese the mouse will go right to it
2915	4	a	Has a million things to choose from and they are so cute
2916	1	a	Absolute junk app force stops will not open does not respond
2917	4	a	Great meaning ful thought for friends life
2918	2	a	App constantly crashes. Cannot connect to PS4. It makes this app totally useless. I see many people are complaining, but is anyone listening? Do you plan on fixing it?? Waste of time.
2919	1	a	Good game but not fun
2920	1	a	"Hver gang man åbner appen skal den ind på deres server og hente oplysningerne, i stedet for at det ligger på mobilen. Dette gør at man ikke kan åbne og vise kort på strækninger med dårlig dækning, eller i tog med dårlig forbindelse. Herudover opdatere kortets status ikke altid rigtigt og viser \ikke gyldigt endnu\"" dage efter at kortet skulle gælde fra."""
2921	4	a	Love it, i've been searching 4this game 4 15years. But why limited number of trials only, we need unlimited option
2922	5	a	Great app.  Easy to use. Good map, to improve in search options. Not possible to invite friends through the app.  This is a MUST ADD
2923	3	a	Photo works reasonably well but the audio lags in the video. Video quality \nisn't great either. Potential is there but needs more work
2924	2	a	Literally?? Now it doesn't give me a FATALE ERROR for freezing, BUT IT DOES THAT WHEN I USE BLZT IT DOES THE SAME THING!!!! Please dude, fix this. For now, I am uninstalling...
2925	1	a	The Challenge- Drop in for Coffee, bring lunch, \u0026 dinner, never open in KC, Mo., Call leave msg. Never call back either. Big Hoax on public. Videos, probably sent to State AG office or Dept. Public Safety to alert for training purposes puts you on hit list. Better send copy to utube for personal safety. Did all this in 1999 before calling Grand Jury about X- Gov. Carnahan who did suicide Plane Crash 2000. Later  published illustrated Book showing Murders, Public Safety, Gov. Nixon and Carnahan  responses.
2926	3	a	Makes u think think think,you think,why is this game so small and why can't I make it bigger
2927	5	a	THAT SQUEAKY NOISE IS SO CUTE!
2928	2	a	I want to know more. Do I get to drag characters here and there and choose my shopping instead of pay for tapping...?
2929	3	a	App updated to latest one. Still crashes after start up.
2930	1	a	Another widget app that just takes you to the settings page. No thanks
2931	3	a	I like it..I want to play in my cp
2932	5	a	Wish the controls where better,but addictive old style racing.
2933	1	a	Bad GUI, SLOW, CONFUSING TO NAVIGATE. Typical Government app costs $MILLIONS $1,000,000s but my grand dad could have designed it for a slab of Vic. Actually at least it would have entertaining animated clip art if my grandfather designed it.
2934	2	a	that can be omitted since unreadable small font, which cannot be adjusted and hard to read softcolors on gray. (preview doesnot show the real thing) . What are the two SDcards of same size in the widget? Did not show me why I cannot update a 500kB app with 500MB RAM free. Is Mem.  free or used?  galaxy tab2 7
2935	4	a	As others said, please increase the contrast between the lines. As I know it, perpendicular hits into the wall are not allowed because you cannot reflect the ball. So I will uninstall and look for another version. Please don't think is a bad app just because I do not agree with its rules.
2936	1	a	It's great love the bold look
2937	1	a	I am 8 years old
2938	4	a	Transits accurately calculated at a glance.  Not Western astrology.
2939	5	a	Have this kind of app in iPhone before, was waiting for the Android version for so long! Great! Thanks!
2940	5	a	Cool game. It gets hard and challenges you but is fun! Reminds me old school games! On steroids!
2941	4	a	Lovely examples, very visual, but rather short, that being the minus element.
2942	1	a	It just isn't working for me. Kinda sucks. I Would probably have liked it though.
2943	4	a	Won't let me purchase the full version
2944	5	a	This is a gr8 farm game. I highly recommend this game to everyone.
2945	4	a	بعطيه 5 لولا إنه وقف فجأة.. تطبيق ممتاز
2946	4	a	Good app I know English grammar it app trough
2947	4	a	Predictions are fun and you actually need to use a bit of math to work out how much you want to vanish. The clear range is lenient but it does get smaller and getting it just right is rewarding.
2948	2	a	Used to really enjoy this game. Once, you reach a certain level. You can no longer win. It regenerates coins every 4 hours which is a plus. But with the poor payouts and unable to win. Bye!! Newbee's its an awesome game. Once you get to level 140. You'll get my frustration.
2949	5	a	" best of luck developer!"""
2950	4	a	But everyone's talking about lives so I might get a different one.
2951	5	a	I'm glad I paid fer full game.  Can't wait fer new stuff n things with this game.....good job
2952	1	a	Good game i have not play it but hope it's a nice game that's if I ever get in.
2953	4	a	it's a piece of mind to have gps coordinates in case of emergency while camping. not sure if its possible, but I think this app could me more valuable if you were able to access it from a locked phone and therefore if something was to happen to me, my family or friends would have access to it. also maybe if it could be linked to rural fire service for fire danger announcements and fire danger ratings
2954	5	a	Amazing port over to android.  Game looks and plays like the original.  The touch controls are ok, to say the least.  Swoop racing is a pain, other then that they work for the rest of the game.  Controller is highly recommended.  Used to have an 8bitdo controller and it worked out of the box with this game great.  I just wish there was an option to turn off most of the touch overlay when using a controller.  But that's nothing to be upset over.  Old but gold and worth every penny.
2955	4	a	Best live Wallpaper I have ever had. But there is a green flashing patch in the top left corner that can be quite annoying.
2956	5	a	Amazing app really enjoy using it although i'd prefer it having an explanation to each riddle still giving it 5 stars though
2957	5	a	Cett radio ma trllmnt mnker. Merci pr lapplikation etan o U.S c tro bn pr ns
2958	5	a	It has helped me to understand the japanese language and culture
2959	4	a	Nedostaje vam pregled SK1 programa. Imate SK, SK2, SK3, SK GOLF.
2960	5	a	Great content and very user friendly. Couldn't get app to work on android 6 though.
2961	5	a	I'm having zero problems! Except when I want to change the emoji keyboard style  from black to white.  It stays black, I want it white?
2962	5	a	This game like plant v zombie
2963	1	a	Does nothing on Samsung s4
2964	1	a	Great idea, a bit laggy game (at a times slow), and too many ads in game while playing
2965	2	a	Whenever I draw a line,the ball moves slowly
2966	3	a	oh no! I left my phone in the explosion. oh, just cracked it   (joke, obviously) : )
2967	1	a	The game itself wasn't bad. Being interrupted every ten seconds or less, however, was too much. I would try to click something and end up opening a pop-up. After the fifth time, I just gave up and uninstalled it.
2968	3	a	Nice game 6 levels than paay please
2969	5	a	Wld B great if it wrked
2970	4	a	Thus game is a really good game that uses time when you are bored, but I would do 5 stars if everything was unlocked AND we didn't have to watch adds to unlock stiff😋😉
2971	5	a	cel putin nu ma inec in tonele de reclame
2972	5	a	Tons of fun and can offer challenge even to experienced players. Really easy to pick up and play, and very, very well made game.
2973	3	a	I like the interface and the functionality. Would have given 5 stars if OSC1 and OSC2 had triangle waves instead of sines, since a sine wave (fundamental) is pretty much useless for subtractive synthesis. Nearly all other subtractive synths provide pulse, saw, and triangle for the main oscillators.
2974	5	a	Salam alaykoum .To whoever copyright was violated...This app is intended to \nshare and spread knowledge...I am sure if your ancestors were alive today \nthey will be pleased to serve the Uma. ! What is knowledge if it's not to \nteach others? What the use of it? To sell and gain money?? There is a \nbigger reward in the hereafter.
2975	4	a	Nice app. Fairly easy to use. I just wish that I could do direct entry of quantity without having to edit the item. IE: scan a barcodes and enter quantity. Not by adding or subtracting, or by editing.
2976	3	a	Some times some offer doesn't work
2977	5	a	Fantastic app,,,i love this apps, ,thinks for having this.
2978	5	a	Dart's game's are my favour and this version is the best one of all. Well done 😊👍*****
2979	1	a	This enormous poorly written game overheats the CPU on a nexus 4, oneplus one and nexus 7 2013. Whilst the game is engaging, it looses out by overheating, eating battery and keeping the screen alive. Play it at your devices peril
2980	1	a	Terrible cannot click anything without getting a pop-up ad... removed after using 20 seconds
2981	5	a	Brilliant, I'd pay for more ...
2982	1	a	Why can't we kick the ball we can only dribble the ball that's not fun !
2983	3	a	I gave you 3 stars bc i hate it bc its lite if you could make it all free i actually gonna give you 5 stars each plss.....
2984	5	a	Helps with my math skills love it try it please
2985	5	a	Good work making this game it was good to me i hope you will keep making games like this and i hope you will make more app so tnx.
2986	5	a	Great app. Best for beginners. But if you know about hacking or if you are a ethical hacker this app is not for you...
2987	1	a	Created account for my Edenred card, when trying to confirm my account it says forbidden.
2988	3	a	Works and does what it should. Real fun.
2989	5	a	These are very nifty puzzles that make you think. I love that about them.
2990	3	a	The reboot screen is so faint that it cannot allow user to reboot the device
2991	5	a	En na de laatste update een stuk stabieler en sneller:)
2992	1	a	Does not want connect because of Security Credssp.
2993	2	a	Android irratti hindalagu. Fix it please
2994	2	a	This game was enjoyable but the more u play the more ads pop up tried 2 x out on some ads 2 continue playing but takes me install the ad that pops up....will give more stars if u fix this problem. . :(
2995	4	a	Just starting playing , and it's good for those like me that have trouble judging distance.
2996	1	a	Pretty fun game. But on nexus 5x with lolipop it crashes constantly. Needs an update.
2997	1	a	Stupid .. Not work with my local gif
2998	1	a	Would the real drift please stand up
2999	5	a	Great app. Been using it for a long time.
3000	2	a	I found this disappointing. Its too fast and repetitive. In a minute I played the same part of the game 7 times. Sure I suck but whats to keep me playing the game after that initial minute of boredom? I also pressed on the ad by accident more than I have any other game. Putting jump on the right side restricts your view as your finger is in the way
3001	2	a	After search route i try share route but app freezing totally. Can't go back.  And app must close by app settings.  I use Android 7.0
3002	4	a	I love this app however can you make this app not to be connected to Internet to play the slogam directly. Thanks.
3003	1	a	Stupid this game is so stupid the songs don't even sound like the real song!!!  It is my first day with this app and I hate it already
3004	5	a	If you play smack the ginger man OK
3005	5	a	I have taken the test twice now and failed...  I learned about this ap and recognize many of the questions that are on the tests I took. Great tool alongside reading the manual! Passed the 3rd time around with the help from this ap! ;)
3006	2	a	"No good at all ... I have so many lyrics in my SD card ... It always say \no lyrics at all\"""""
3007	3	a	got both versions of this app and couldn't find how (or even if) the clock is displayed on the lock screen. in the photos, it shows the clock on the lock screen, so i figured it's a feature, but it's not happening! otherwise, nice widget! (please add customizable positioning to lock screen \u0026 I'll pay again!) update: still can't get it on lock screen,  but on home screen it looks/works pretty darn nice.
3008	5	a	Bhat hi bdiya app h
3009	3	a	....now it fails a LoT! uninstalling.
3010	3	a	I purchased this app to update my call logs to Salesforce. So far it's been well worth the money because I can service my accounts \u0026 sell to my prospects without the repetitive minutia of data entry.   Therefore  I can focus on ultimately more important tasks like closing \u0026 winning more business.
3011	4	a	The rest is locked...we just cant play only one type when there are many others...it should be unlock for free..
3012	5	a	I think this is more fun then Foppy Bird. This is easier to use.
3013	1	a	Previously slow and unstable...Now unusable! Cant pass the pending screen to valid a checking. Are people paid for creating such an app? Might have been an intern that left (that would explain why the app doesnt work at all anymore). This is a shame for Accor Hotels, you guys should delist the app as it serves no purpose anyway.
3014	1	a	Doesn't have the option for categories or any way to organize. Have no idea what 'amount in class' means, but this wasn't useful for craft supply inventory.
3015	5	a	Great app You could expand it with day signs or make a separate app on the same basis.
3016	1	a	Sucks after installing it it just asks you install more software
3017	1	a	Appgratis sent me here. Wasted time downloading it. Crashes on attempting to open.
3018	5	a	The effects are simply amazing. It works so well on my Galaxy Y
3019	1	a	Its very bad graphics are rubbish and its not worth buying the ful game
3020	5	a	I like it, cute nd looking nice
3021	1	a	I can't get this app to load fully. I open it up and it always crashes when it is initializing the database. I have Android 7.1.1 on a ZTE.
3022	1	a	Scam apps tell you to download more what a sham , too many ads!
3023	5	a	This app is perfect! Perfect for jellybean o.s . I use it on my old Samsung \nand it saved me many times! Plus you can send fake texts and the app is \nfree! Love it sooo much
3024	3	a	Its a little bit buggy in my phone
3025	5	a	نتمنى اضافة خاصية تدوير الشاشة للتطبيق
3026	1	a	" Altho my location' s ON it says I'm in Kyrgyz idtjgykh or (sm unfrikinheardof place like dat) ....WWAAAAYYYYYY OOFFFFFFFFF! iow FaKe!😐👎"""
3027	4	a	I'm using a lgg3, w/ an AOSP ROM. Needless to say, nothing works as well as the stock LG camera for this device, however this App does a fantastic job, super sharp and easy to use. Not missing my stock camera anymore.
3028	1	a	I tried multiple times to get this to work but it doesn't. It's a black screen for 3 seconds then closes. And before you ask, yes I did uninstall and reinstall and that did work either there for, 0 if I could rate that. Sorry but not sorry.
3029	2	a	Galls Panic! - Design simples. Para acertar a linha, não arraste o dedo, clique no centro de onde você quer criá-la. 2*.
3030	5	a	Just..... Wow. I really hope the artist and designer of this masterpiece give us more in this vein.
3031	5	a	For all of those people who write a bad review, they must not know how to go to the forums and contact customer service. ANY issue I have ever had has been resolved quickly. True, it takes gems for many items, but every week there are NEW items, some which cost game coins. IF you cook food, you DO earn gems, and get free gems for downloading featured Teamlava games. You have to play and level up to gain better decor, but What game isn't like that already?? This is a fun, easy game once you learn the basics.
3032	5	a	It's a lovely game it's good fun I love dogs but please could you add more things to do with the dog and maybe more dogs two. I like to be able to take it for a walk that would be cool thank you.
3033	4	a	It is. nice to famous our personality
3034	4	a	Its a vry gd game.. its a vry special for me in my boaring  tym.
3035	4	a	I love this app.  I use it everyday. My only gripe is that it some times prints sideways and there is nothing you can do to adjust the page so that it fits and prints like it should.  I use an HP Office jet 150 mobile printer and this app is vital to print via Bluetooth on the road.
3036	4	a	I like thos game but it gets a bit borring Libbi games with all the salon and nail games, i know other people like these games and omg! Who would not?
3037	1	a	No content? It's just stuck loading and doesnt show any content at all. Has been going for a long times now. Fix this please...
3038	5	a	Very happy with this app
3039	5	a	I have suffered from tinnitus since I was 7 yrs old. As it has gotten worse the white nose with 2nd noise generator active from this app is a lifesaver. I couldn't get work done now without it when my ringing is acting up.
3040	5	a	Works fine, nice UI. Too bad the ads are greatly limiting visibility.
3041	4	a	The 3year old that I take care of likes it a lot but it can be a little glitchy at times.
3042	5	a	Simple one touch... exactly what I wanted. Simple home screen one click on ane one click off. Nice job
3043	4	a	Only problem is the annoying ads that get in the way of the screen.   Wish there was a paid app of this without the ads.
3044	5	a	Kanda yaseen hogatho acha tha
3045	5	a	I came across this app while searching customizng status bar spps and just had to give it a try. This is such a nifty app that really makes my screen unique...too cool. I ended up purchasing the extension to access more designs. Love it!
3046	5	a	Love it 💖💋 best camera affect ive dwnloaded 👍👍👍👍
3047	5	a	My brother likes buses so I just said EXCELLENT
3048	5	a	I love samueijh1 he hás the best apps ever like this one i was wondering is u can make sure u update u r skywars app tô 0.12.1 or 0.12.2
3049	1	a	No audio when lock screen activates on my s7 edge, so the app is pretty much useless until this is resolved.  Other apps play fine with the lock screen on so don't think it's a phone setting that's causing the problem.
3050	4	a	Works for xbox one better together.  Saved me so much time and deaths in the nether
3051	2	a	Di input no. Resi tidak bisa copy atau paste. Kalo resi dikirim via sms harus ngapalin nomer atau harus buka tutup sms untuk melihat nomer resi.
3052	1	a	Without notice 5.9$ has been debited to my Citibank Card. This is Cheating
3053	2	a	How on earth is this fair???? The description says free version, when you click on the next stage to unlock, you have to buy!!!! Whats the meaning of the word FREE then?????
3054	5	a	I like this app. It's fun to use and realy helpful.
3055	4	a	Best app.what is the use of coins in this app.Is it possible to convert into money
3056	5	a	5 star rating because of what I observed while devouring the apps. It was awesome.
3057	4	a	Developer should try fading black all around like a vignette filter almost
3058	5	a	Cute snowglobes for the holiday season! Love the ease of this app
3059	3	a	It's a good and informative app.
3060	5	a	Great fun and addictive game!
3061	5	a	Great application to keep my private stuff secure.
3062	1	a	DO NOT be fooled by the good reviews, this app is so bad. It glitches so much. And when you make the video it takes forEVER to load. So don't waste your time of storage for this app😴

3073	5	a	Alhamdolillah , zindagi ko yaksar tabdeel kr deny waly Bayanat , lazmi suniye.
3074	4	a	Your location on BMA rain map is fantastic. You'd make cyclists happy if \nyou did the same for BMA's wind direction data too.
3075	1	a	Moodbidri branch is worst of all!staff arent working properly!
3076	5	a	I really like this game. It has got me through many a boring situation
3077	1	a	I couldn't even add my first vehicle. As soon as I chose the make, it crashed
3078	4	a	Would have been better if there were explanations to the solutions
3079	3	a	I would give 5 if I could play it      it opens then closes
3080	5	a	This is my absolute favorite Live Wallpaper, anytime I change to a diff LW I always miss this one \u0026 go right back to it. But, here's an idea. It would be triple the awesomeness if you could make a way to sync this LW not only with night/day but with the weather. I'd love that!!!
3081	5	a	I didnt think I would love it as much as I do. The gameplay is very fluid the controls are easy once you get used to them and its fun af. Definitely more content, an open world,expansions.
3082	4	a	Checking my lottery is easy.
3083	5	a	It a good game from me to play
3084	5	a	Great defense game, really hard to put down. Extremely fun.
3085	4	a	Geart app But should have picture. WORKS great on my HTC MY-TOUCH.
3086	5	a	Thanks from the hard work. This software still have a problem in My Galaxy s5. I cannot use the question mark for Pashto Interrogative sentence. I mean that I can write (?) but NOT (؟). Can anyone help me?  Thanks
3087	1	a	" daca nu.. mai cauta."""
3088	4	a	Its a nice game but i wish you could do more i just want to do makeup and dress up ps. Great time killer
3089	3	a	To many are and it stalls at time which make me get out and get back in to finish playing.  Other than that I like the game.
3090	5	a	It's lovely I like this...
3091	5	a	Superb game to develop reflexes and motor skills...
3092	1	a	I installed it but now it won't even open so i can put it as new message theme.it really stupid
3093	4	a	Like it, but give me chance to use it I was going in settings to set up and you want me to rate it too quickly, but  so far it's very nice After installed kept crashing, black screen  for a very long time
3094	5	a	The only app out of many I tried that let me use all 5 fingers instead of just 2. Excellent work.
3095	1	a	Turns off as the screen turns off... I don't understand why that is. No feature to set a time for the nap and I don't know how long the recording is as it doesn't say so anywhere. What a waste of download.
3096	1	a	extremely difficult, image is sideways and very small during editing. I wasn't able to accomplish my goal.
3097	4	a	This game is very good game my daughter always play this game she loved it
3098	4	a	The app is really nice. There are a lot of ways to improve, I think. It \nwould be much better if the estimate of price would be seen before you send \na request for a driver so that you have an estimate of how expensive your \nride would be.
3099	5	a	Is beautiful game for play whit my kid's ilove that I love that I love playing with my kids thank you God for giving me another opportunity foreplay can make it thank you my babies to foreplay with me and thank you everybody make the players for Dr in kids fathers please fake with your kids is the best you make in your life the kids love it play it
3100	1	a	What the hell can't even play the game. Keeps kicking me out. Tired of downloading games only to uninstall because the game will not open to play.
3101	1	a	Used to be a very good app, it was easy to use. All I want is local bus time tables, which was what it started with. Unless the buses are tracked, which they don't appear to be, what is the point of knowing where they are supposed to be? Bring back the original, it did the job. Update. Despite updates it seems to have got worse. Just spent 30 mins trying to get the times of my local bus, would have been quicker to walk to my nearest bus stop to look on the timetable. Please just publish bus timetables by locality, it would save a lot of time and frustration.
3102	5	a	Thanks for the Qibla AR application. Beautifully helping me to pray any place any where. Thanks for the App team. Allah is the Greatest. Jazak Allah.
3103	5	a	Always say connection failed. I recommend developer to try again make it a new app with better interface, and better qlty and few extra options but focus on camera on  pay app yes a free option with watermark and less options and ads, and can be save on different options so can be post on Instagram and Facebook, instead of the pain of web page maintaining, and maybe just Facebook, Instagram or Google plus accounts. They could try again now that can share short clips on those social sites.
3104	4	a	This. Is a good all for is sister
3105	5	a	I loved it but can you add weather effects plz but the graphis are good😀
3106	4	a	Pretty reliable scrobbler.  I haven't had much issue with double scrobbling (unlike other apps). It doesn't scrobble plays from the Bandcamp app, though.  I will give 5 stars if you include that.
3107	5	a	Tried dozens of crappy viewer apps, this is the only one that works with my cheapie no-name Dvr on HTC Desire \u0026 Nexus 7
3108	5	a	Super app but 4g intranet
3109	1	a	Går ej att skanna in fordon på min OnePlus 6 då hela skannings-sidan är skev...
3110	1	a	There are no directions. I don't know how to set it up so I'm uninstalling.
3111	4	a	"There is a bug that caused me to lose all my save data on the character I was using, and it would be appreciated if it was fixed. I undid my last 10 steps, then tried to go upstairs. A warning screen popped up saying \The file was not found for some reason\"" and kicked me to the class select screen."""
3112	5	a	Ive used this on a dozen gog games to boot, from arcanum to star empires 4. It all works flawlessly and i love how i can just unpack it right into the exagear folder. It does exactly what it says itll do. Only real complaint is the percentage numbers are a bit wonky but it always unpacks at the end. Great work
3113	1	a	It's the most boring  game ever. for the person who said the people suck and not the game just because they said it does not work well it might not for them and the person is the one that sucks wich is called angel something
3114	1	a	I decided not to use because I disagreed with the terms of service. I believe I can find an app with pretty much the same features.
3115	5	a	Fun and challenging!  Hard to put down once you started!
3116	5	a	High quality of images. Thanks
3117	5	a	It's awesome. But a little difficult to connect through WiFi.
3118	5	a	Denke ist die beste app fachlich sachlich hervorragend
3119	5	a	THIS IS SUCH A COOL APP I LOVE IT SO MUCH!☺☺☺☺
3120	1	a	I see wat u meen emily,that happened to me.So its fun at first,then,its Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooobad.lol.    ^_^

3122	5	a	Remember the days of Dragon Warrior (did u get it with your Nintendo Power subscription) \u0026 Dragon Warrior II?  Play an RPG just like the great 8-bit days! This provided hours of fun for me. A little bit of a grind at some parts for some money for better armor, but I love doing that in games!
3123	5	a	Stress reliever hope to have an update soon
3124	4	a	Good app, I use it regularly
3125	5	a	I've been looking all over Play Store for a solid musical tapping game. I've downloaded and tried so many but this was the one I've been looking for simply because sync is on point. It's not entirely accurate, but it's accurate enough for me to easily follow the beat of a song and rack up tons of perfect hits for an SSS rank. You're not going find better than this.
3126	5	a	Kindly make it compatible to landscape users aswell  I have roadmate XP-11 display head unit powered by Android when I try to install this app it shows a message not compatible for your device.
3127	1	a	Waste of money. They tell you to install Adobe air AFTER purchasing, you try to install it and it says it's not available.
3128	5	a	I LOVED PLAYING WHEN I WAS A KID 😍
3129	3	a	Isme bahut thode time ke liye animal sound aati hai
3130	3	a	The app used to work on my old phone and it was perfect, but now on a galaxy it won't sign in and says request timed out, please help me sign in if know a fix for it
3131	5	a	My average is like 40.
3132	1	a	I cant open it cause it keeps crashing. I would love to play please help me.
3133	3	a	I've bought this game way back on my iPhone 4s and I really loved it. I don't understand, why is this not the same bowmaster game as it is for iphone? I assumed this was the lite version but it's not. if there was the $0.99 version I totally buy it. I miss the courses and wooden creatures!!!
3134	5	a	I passed the 501 exam on my first try today, and this app helped me  get there.  It doesn't replace reading Gibson's textbook, but it's a useful portable resource.  Towards the end of my studies, I just kept doing practice tests on this app until I consistently scored in the 90s.  The flashcards are relevant and the practice test questions are in a style similar to the real thing.   Tl;dr: it was worth the money.
3135	3	a	Didnt work on moto x2
3136	5	a	I'm not sure yet, but as soon as I find out if I like the app or not, I'll \ncome back and rate .
3137	5	a	A lot of cracked screen apps out there to fool but it's the best of them or you can say those are miles away from this awsm app .
3138	1	a	Não abre. Talvez seja incompatibilidade com o ART.
3139	3	a	Do any of you guys fly real planes because in a real plane if you pull the steering stick to you will ascend and if you push it out you will descend so in that case the steering is correct
3140	4	a	I like the game but I was supposed to get 958 N-Points for getting to level 3 in coin master and haven't gotten it yet.
3141	4	a	Love the game but what happened to Minion forest? I miss that game :c
3142	1	a	I would like to play the game it get to the screen where it says Simple Games Studio© and then it wont load please fix
3143	1	a	Takes so long to build up coins for boosts or keys because the payout IF you ever win is so little. Nice colors and graphics but thats about it.
3144	1	a	No use this app,  staff no response,  dont use the this app,  dont encourage  this app,,
3145	3	a	all I can say is.....more themes please...if you want your customers to be happy of your product always keep them satisfied.....but nice apo though.....I love it just add soooo much themes.....thanks for reading my review
3146	4	a	On multiplayer mode whenever I refresh or sometimes try to enter an online game it keeps telling me Terminal Time out please try again later. And if I enter a game and it starts glitching I try to leave but the OK button won't click. I love this game and I hate not playing.😢 If you fix it I would rate 5 stars again 🌟
3147	5	a	सर . प्रसाद बुकिंग वाला सिस्टम चालू कर दीजिए
3148	5	a	Sehr hilfreiches, gut funktionnierendes Nachschlagewerk! Macht einen sehr vollständigen Eindruck. Danke für die humanen Berechtigungen!
3149	5	a	This is a great app.. Simple with the options of using different audio cues even your own voice recording for triggering livid dreams. You can even program phone to vibrate.
3150	5	a	Paolo Fox you are the best
3151	5	a	Omg its d thing i wazz looking for guyzz yew mast try dis its really bestt i've tried manyy other applocks but its d bestest yew awl mast try dis
3152	5	a	My new go to uninstaller, this app does a great job, with no ads. I've \ntried dozens and used one that also had no ads, it's no longer available so \nmy search began again. After finding this one and it doing such a good job \nit's one of my first installs on a fresh reset. Great job to the developer, \nthanks!
3153	1	a	Nothing but adds pop up upon opening this application. Trying to close ads results in more ads
3154	3	a	Every thing is ok, except alphabets which shown in the theme are not here after installation in xperia z2.
3155	1	a	I just wanted to purchase an issue of the alternative movies release, but no luck
3156	1	a	I can't use. Because xperia tags are read only.
3157	1	a	Give rid of some of the ads and I will give 5 stars. Or put in an option to exit the ad 5 to 10 seconds in. And what is the jolly thing for. I'm not to pleased with the constant pestering about it
3158	1	a	Upload not working and no new photod simce 2014
3159	1	a	Waste of time and effort. Offers you the option to type in an ip address but it's keypad has no decimal point.
3160	5	a	People said it's really good so I like it as well
3161	5	a	It's great, free, and fun
3162	1	a	Plus every time you try to go back a screen it exits
3163	5	a	Fantastic app! This app has changed my life. I'm sleeping again. Not only is it helping me fall asleep, but when I use this app, for some reason I'm sleeping more soundly and waking more rested. I bought the full version and I'm so glad I did. Also, bought the Body meditation for healing, but haven't had a chance to try it yet. I'm sure it'll be great, too.
3164	5	a	The quality is head and shoulders above other icons. These are truly in a class by themselves!
3165	5	a	Super fun even for the little kids and the music is cool you should definitely buy it
3166	5	a	This game is really awesome its like plants vs zombies and clash of clans mixed together with cute graphics. I cant beleive ur the same guy/s who created magicite loved that game. cant wait for pixel kingdom 2. can u add some characters from magicite to the next update or pixel kingdom 2 please? itll be awesome and some enemies from the game too thnx :*
3167	3	a	Like the game it is great but you can't send gifts or add friends otherwise the game crashes please fix the problem for 5 star
3168	1	a	Doesn't work .. When i click on search .lrc it doesnt find any lyrics from file for me..
3169	5	a	I am Muslim and i love holly Quran
3170	4	a	This app is great in that it counts not just calories etc but a complete breakdown of vitamins and minerals from food and drinks consumed. The only downside is that the list of food and drink to choose from is limited and except for wholefoods is not brand compatible with British users. However there is the option to add in custom foods (if you can find a complete nutritional profile to copy for them elsewhere).
3171	3	a	It doesn't change all my icons. Any suggestions to make it works?
3172	4	a	.. i love it.. but how can i get the hello kitty collection of this launcher...???
3173	5	a	This app saves so much setup time and space when playing Arkham, it's amazing. Can we get one for Eldritch Horror, too?!!
3174	1	a	Game no good and can't play as more adverts than game ,rubbish don't play.
3175	2	a	Why 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😤😤😤😤😤😤😠😤 ads mostly every app as them why so much i HATE them so stop pease so bad and i did  loss a lot of storage 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏well done 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😣😣😣😣🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀so piz stop that 😠😠😒😒😒😒😒🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😭😭😭😭😭😭😭kk bye and DONT Get it😣😣😣😮😮😮😮😰😧😧😧😧🐶🐶🐶
3176	1	a	L'app fonctionne avec leur mots, mais si j'entre mon vocabulaire...il n'apparait pas!
3177	5	a	I receive this theme as a gift .But my brother accidentally uninstall it .Now i want to use it back. kindly make this as free pls i really love this theme.Thank you much
3178	1	a	I dont care who copy which or who came first, but this game is sucks!  FB is still the best.
3179	1	a	Deze app toont geen neerslagkaarten meer. Uitgeprobeerd op verschillende toestellen. Versie voor Nederland werkt prima.
3180	5	a	I bought the upgrade so my brother could have an iLand too but every time I go to create a second one it doesn't work :-(  Everything else works fine but please fix it, apart from that I LOVE it :-)
3181	5	a	I like the icons but I don't own go launcher so it's a bit messed up for it to work but my launcher does allow the icons to work from any pack. My one problem is most apps that are built in are left alone which shouldn't happen even if the pack is for a different launcher than mine as well as I miss my marshmallow icons with this on since I don't like the lollipop icons.
3182	5	a	I love how easy it was, to set up on my phone with this app. It's annoying that it never opens, without going to an add for a bigger better, newer camera first. If I want a new camera, I'll look it up. Just please open, so I can see what's going on in my house. We've had a lot of people going through for viewings. And we'd like to keep an eye on our stuff.
3183	4	a	Please change the yellow colour to a shade of grey or Lollipop green in contacts. Looks out of place.
3184	1	a	Slow and boring\nWorst graphics  i ever seen \nDont waste ur time in downloading the app\nWhy it is there in market ? Uninstalled!
3185	4	a	very fun and easy to learn
3186	1	a	Com2uS and Gamevil use this third party widget called HIVE. Now, I have never created an account with any game created by either company, yet HIVE claims I've exceeded my account limit and 'can't create more IDs'. I've tried several work arounds, including installing other games with HIVE like 'Tower Defense', 'Summoners War' and 'Zenonia S: rifts in time' to no avail. Instead, I will be abstaining from any game created by either company in the future, regardless of fixes (because I'm spiteful like that.)
3187	1	a	I was trying to register my subcard when I was on step 2 it sais password was updated and will be redirected to a page to choose a new password that didn't happen tried 3 times ...app is broken.
3188	1	a	Feel free to compare it and you too will uninstall it almost instantly.
3189	3	a	Graphics are not good enough......improve it .  Plzzzzz
3190	5	a	Really impressed by the news that a bushwalking grand father got saved from a deadly snakebite . Downloaded the app and found that it's the simplest intelligent app I had everseen simple and straight forward.. the app is enabled with geotagging...
3191	5	a	I loved it ! It works
3192	5	a	My friends said it was good so i tried it and it was really good but sometimes challenging
3193	1	a	This app tricks you guys like literally. At first it told me that i didn't have room so i deleted some apps that are good then i realized that this app tricks you guys so always be alert and cautioned about the app because don't always expect it's going to be good just by the pictures, in fact the pictures 📷 i think are from the internet just posted here to supposedly say it's great and good but no so people learn from my mistakes please because your wasting time and yeah so learn from this experience 😡😧
3194	3	a	It functions fine on mobile, its just not very fun to me. The UI of a touch screen is perfect for type of game it is, but it turns out the camera is far too zoomed in and it feels very slippery, probably because your thumb inevitably blocks your vision of what you are about to place. Im suprised its got such a high rating, ive had more fun with free mobile games. Not that 5 is too expensive, the game is just over rated
3195	5	a	Good game even has a free flight mode?! Why whould u tell me sooner
3196	5	a	وجد هذا البرنامج مساعد جداً فى اﻻستمرار في قراءة القرآن الكريم فى اى وقت ومكان
3197	5	a	It's a pretty decent game I like the fact that you have training and gameplay. What I didn't like is the cash button and you have to pay coins to upgrade, but overall I give it a 4 stars
3198	5	a	ممنون ازلطف شما عالی عالی
3199	5	a	Every Muslims need this app.... mashaallah
3200	1	a	It's like a stupid flappy bird game.
3201	5	a	best tennis games in android
3202	5	a	For more stars from new users, I recommend explaining that all you have to do is swipe the space bar to change the dictionary. I wouldn't know, if it wasn't for a fellow user explaining in the comments. That being said. I'm an Américan. Most Spanish speakers speak American Spanish. We require a dictionary for the majority of Spanish speakers of the world, not just Spaniards. We need a Central American and South American dictionaries. I'm still giving full stars though.
3203	1	a	Because ask where and from there I can play very very stupid game
3204	5	a	An exceptionally well designed app, geared towards efficiency and convenience. Life made easy 👌
3205	1	a	Installation fails on HTC One_M8 running stock rooted 5.0.1. The installer appears to place an APK inside /system/priv-app/ but said APK doesn't run.
3206	5	a	Great app. No drama and send money quickly. They even have a help tab for extra time incase you can't make the deadline.
3207	5	a	Would be good to have a one-click-set-alarm button for the upcoming session when notified.
3208	1	a	Couldn't even open and crash
3209	5	a	Used to work perfectly with my xz premium, but now it won't work on my temporary xz1. This app definitely needs an update. And your tablets need on too, we would forgive even for a last year hardware setup as well. Just make it happen.
3210	5	a	Excellent app, reliable and well thought out. Doesn't seem to take much battery power. Highly recommended.
3211	1	a	So boring  all you have to do is  stoot the sharks
3212	5	a	i would like to register my self too
3213	5	a	This app is so easy to use that you get addicted!thank you!
3214	5	a	I am pakistani but i respect indian ppl and their country  but media and leader  of both country r useless 😠 they do not want we meet us first we r humen then its india or pak  secondly ppl of pakistan mostly come from india at distribution so we r same 😊
3215	4	a	" through that bar isn't very high."""
3216	5	a	This is so cool! I did at least 5 or 6 pictures .and the best part is U Can Write On  your pictures!!!!!!!
3217	1	a	Whenever i shut phone down and turn back on its some wallpaper that came with phone is now selected. Fix that issue then will get higher score
3218	3	a	It's fun enough but it keeps loading gallery images sideways.
3219	1	a	" only takes up valuable space."""
3220	5	a	Takes a checks long time to download doe
3221	3	a	Saves most of the screen for text, auto-formats, and (YES!) auto-continues lists. Requests only one wee permission, \u0026 though it doesn't sync it saves files in a known place so I can use Dropsync. Excellent!  BUT: doesn't support asterisk lists (which normal Markdown does, \u0026 which my non-MD desktop notes program uses), the auto-list prevents nesting, it squanders its screen space by double-spacing (!!!) the text, \u0026 has little hope for improvement b/c it hasn't updated in almost 2 years. :-(
3222	5	a	" because it has everything I was looking for... and more! Great app!"""
3223	5	a	Omg I love wolves!!! Thank u 4 making this app!!! XD
3224	5	a	Jazakallah khayran for an easy to use app with powerful duas for Ramadan. Love the new audio feature that makes learning the dua much easier.
3225	5	a	Very handy app, everything I needed for fast reference. The only thing I would suggest is to improve UI, and search.
3226	5	a	Does what it says without hassle, perfect! Just another design that should have been part of android since gingerbread.
3227	4	a	still had ads after buying 10$ pkg, more ads than before it seem like. AHHHHH. All care Bears do the same thing instead of each being different such as music, art, clothes, food, ect...but my 3yr does love it so 4 stars
3228	1	a	Hey i bought d platinum feature today for 1 year for rs 3000 .... i dnt even get a response from ur g2m person ... wen il i get accessed .... dnt try to cheat me .... othetwise u il b fooled by ur action
3229	5	a	With the ability to add multiple accounts and the intuitive interface this app blows any other minecraft chat app out of the water. The only problem is it always shows 5000+ ping for every server. It connects fine though.
3230	1	a	After installing, it's showing connection error though I use WiFi or mobile connection.....
3231	5	a	This is cool because there is a winter theme or other else it's beautiful I like winter season :)
3232	1	a	The app show to be saving my SMS messages but when I tried to restore them \nit locked up and close down.
3233	1	a	Its very bad apps for me .i try to convert mp4 to mp3 but it doesnt work out..n never convert ...make sure try to improve more
3234	1	a	I hated it so hard to control and hard to play I don't recommend you get \nthis game and wast your time I'm only ten I think this game is stupid \nMinecraft is better and the way you jump what the heck?
3235	4	a	This is a great app for me. I am 65 and it helps keep my mind active. However, it would be better if I could get rid of the ads.
3236	5	a	Great!!! Recomended to all Malaysian drivers.
3237	1	a	Um.... how do you sign out  of the app? I can't find anything on here to help with this and there is not search or help on here? Not a good way to start a new app.. so confused...
3238	5	a	It works like it says, you will notice a better battery life.
3239	5	a	Nice + nine time champion
3240	5	a	This is a very good first person dungeon crawling game. Cant wait to see the add on content. Keep up the good work.
3241	4	a	The full screen button should be  on the first screen once you choose a picture to view
3242	5	a	Great app. I love it.
3243	1	a	Childish graphics.. Hate it.. Rubbish
3244	5	a	I've been smoking for 23 years, pack a day.  I haven't quit yet, but am down to 6, sometimes less.  The fact that it is so structured is perfect, longer the intervals, the more you are forced to just work through the cravings.  Living in NY where cigs are $10/pack, just cutting down a little bit w/ this app has been a tremendous savings!!!
3245	5	a	This app allowed me to connect to my Sony MDR BRT-10 headphones. My NFC wouldn't work without it! Awesome app just install and your headphones can now connect.
3246	5	a	I love it you should get it
3247	3	a	Boring never play this game if you 11 and up ugh I'm disgusted
3248	4	a	My son likes the game, a lot, hence the four stars. However, we made two in-app purchases but it doesn't allow us to access them. It acts as though we never made said purchases, but I have the receipt to prove we did. I have sent an email and am waiting for a response.
3249	3	a	This game is very nice. It's really heroic but I am giving 3 stars because it stops when I create a super hero. Please fix this and I will give you 5 stars.
3250	5	a	Brill app, used on many phones. Seems to be glitchy on ics as will occassionally show small pic on all screens. To fix I select another live wallpaper then select this one again. Please fix
3251	3	a	Not very very good.My sister don't like very this game  but she play   another  nail salon than this game.Me too😐
3252	5	a	It's a cool game and interesting
3253	2	a	Fingerprint doesn't work on nexus 6p Android 7.1.1 😞
3254	5	a	Only reason to root a g3. Phones great except the weird quiet headphone problem.  Thanks so much!!!
3255	3	a	It's a very good game
3256	4	a	Its really hard and if one of your characters dies, they're gone forever. \nHowever, that being said, it is incredibly fun with an awesome research \ntree and combat system. It will eat your time up and you won't be able to \nquit once you get into it!
3257	3	a	Its a bit complicated. But i had fun with the app. It would be even nicer if you were able to record your vocals to the beat
3258	5	a	Dear Team.. Why ain't you guys create a widget to easily toggle between 3g and 4g?please
3259	5	a	without children the next generation would thank us
3260	4	a	I used to play this type of game (in physical form) all the time as a child. To be able to play it on my phone now is amazing, and it's also way more extended which is of course a plus. Love the little facts you get when finishing a level!
3261	4	a	Also love that it's resizable now. But once in a while the numbers change to very small size.
3262	1	a	I am only giving 1 star because it quit working after my update to android pie.
3263	5	a	@@_$_Highly Recommend, BIG Launcher, should be Default on all Android Mobile Phones, Please keep Updates Up to Date, Download Now should be On everyone's Phones.
3264	5	a	The way it speeds . Awesome!
3265	4	a	add eng sub pls. It would be great xD
3266	3	a	Am I the only one who can't get the stone to curl to the right?
3267	3	a	Love the game itself. But I bought the game yesterday and have played for a few hours so far. Now when I log on, certain features don't work and cause crashes. I can't even walk through loading areas without a crash. If you can fix this that would be great, but if I could get a refund that would be even better. Thank you for your time
3268	1	a	I would rate much higher but if you give the option for us not to be asked again to rate your game. DO NOT KEEP ASKING ME TO RATE YOUR GANE!!!!!
3269	2	a	It won't let me play it because when i turn it on it just loads and loads and loads! After about twenty minutes, I gave up!
3270	4	a	"Super simple, works every time. Only issue is if silent is enabled when app kicks in when the time is up for app to \quit\"" it's goes to lowest volume setting. I've missed a few calls in AM because of this. Fix that and it's a 5 all day long"""
3271	2	a	الامر يستغرق بعض الوقت عند الخروج من البرنامج  ولماذا اضطر لتحميل الفيديو حتى أرسله على الواتس اب؟؟؟؟؟؟
3272	3	a	Even with the bike, how are opponents beating me using the same or lesser vehicles? App does what it says.
3273	5	a	I like this game it has great graphics
3274	4	a	its a good app. not the best app but thats ok with me
3275	4	a	Doesn't seem to work for Android v7. I'm giving it 4 stars in case I'm not doing something correct. Anyone else get it to list more than just System Monitor running?
3276	1	a	"Sadly, you download it, and it doesn't even show anywhere on your phone. Only option is the \uninstall\"" button here"""
3277	1	a	Frances gilmore dont worry look up elf yourself its great try it oh and u \ncan use elf yourself flr chrismas to!
3278	4	a	Absolutely worth the money.. Just wish it had more levels
3279	2	a	Can't connect to Facebook. Freezes up sometimes. Game could be better with some tweaks.Improve point system.
3280	3	a	Fun and Addictive watch your fish grow breed new species research and sell at a price you choose as all that is brilliant about the game however the reason for my 3* rating is the game runs when you are not on the game so your fish are getting older and hungry so you must make sure your constantly logging on and off every 5 minutes or so, which I don't think is good especially if you can't get on it all your fish die! But as I said still a good game would recommend
3281	1	a	ดูจากวันที่ แอพนี้ก็เปิดมาหลายปีแล้ว แต่ดูเหมือนไม่มีความก้าวหน้าในการพัฒนา \nประการแรกโหลดช้ามากๆทั้งๆที่ผ่านไวไฟ ที่สำคัญคือข้อมูลไม่เป็นปัจจุบัน \nภาพกล้องจราจรยังเป็นของสองสามวันที่แล้วอยู่ การใส่บริการไว้มากมายดูเหมือนดี \nแต่ถ้าอัพเดทไม่ทันไม่ครบก็จบครับ
3282	1	a	It didn't duo anything so I deleted it and I now have this app that won't go away.
3283	2	a	يحتاج إلى تحسين والاعلانات مسوية زحمة
3284	4	a	I wish they had Costco's deals in the app. Also, it gets 4 stars because the rite aid ads never work at all! Please fix it!
3285	5	a	It is the best little game ever
3286	2	a	Fun and worked for months. But now it closes frequently in middle of game.
3287	5	a	Recommend to anyone who is interested in math.
3288	5	a	Great way to learn to play like in the casino, or improve yourself. All in \nall it is a fun game to and play.
3289	1	a	It would not let me go on it😤
3290	5	a	SOMEONE HACKED MY PHONE AND WROTE THIS LOL JK
3291	3	a	Not bad for starters...  I´m missing:   1) change color of the signature (blue, for instance) instead od default black 2) rotate signature; curently, only one can be created and not rotated. so if u need to sign a PDF in landscape format, no joy...  edit: also missing: 3) connection to Adobe ID, so that I could use the same sig with adobe reader on my WIN10 Laptop  and then there is the fact that the adobe acrobat reader does support all the above on both my WIN10 machine and my android mobile. so why use this one as well ?
3292	5	a	It didnt work at all! After uninstalling it, it will randomly say my sisters name, very annoying especially in the middle of the night. I am very sorry I installed this to begin with.
3293	1	a	I'm not buying tons of pics or downloading other apps just to get pictures.
3294	5	a	To all those dissing cause it doesn't work its not meant to its a prank!Read the description
3295	4	a	Немного мутно работает заказ более одной машины - точнее его отслеживание
3296	5	a	So so so so cuuuuuuutttttttte \u003c3.\u003c3
3297	3	a	I am giving just 3 stars no pragraph or separate line
3298	3	a	Esta divertida la historia, pero los controles del juego son torpes y lentos
3299	1	a	لايقوم بالتحويل لباقة ال 94
3300	3	a	This game is good, but incredibly similar to a VR game I've played called Polyrunner VR. If you have any relation, please tell me.
3301	5	a	This is the definitive Dragon Quest Portal for the Android Smart phone. It allows in-app purchases of other dragon quest Android Games (DQ1, DQ2, DQ4, DQ8). It also offers app downloads for other SQEX Games. One thing I like is the continuous Dragon Quest news you receive for SQEX Store items, news and other game campaign information. Its a Must if you are a DQ Fan.  Again this is Japanese Language Only.
3302	5	a	I track all of Aaron videos. He is dedicated to guide us \u0026 Straightforward to the info he wants to deliver in a funny way, he exerts gr8 efforts to deliver new info. I Rate him A1
3303	5	a	This is a very innovative way of composing and taking photos. Like that manual control points can be added to the composition and they are followed while inside the visible area. The quality of HDR is also very good. On the other hand I didn't find any special things on the video side, except that the image may be distorted (skew effect), when the phone is tilted.
3304	4	a	I try to use this
3305	5	a	It works,  even better if your phone has a rubber case ON. Its good that you can change the settings for better sound.
3306	4	a	Flaky occasionally but it does what it says without too much  intrusion.thumbs up.
3307	5	a	Really addicted...I really use my mind to the limit...hihihi👍
3308	5	a	IF YOU THINK THIS GAME IS DUMB YOU ARE DUMB
3309	2	a	I downloaded but couldn't add to my ringtone list on my phone.
3310	2	a	U only get Half a game. The page to get map for augmented. Reality is no longer available. I guess Co. Went under or something.
3311	1	a	Terrible i have seen much better than this .. shocking
3312	5	a	Please try to understand The O situation and I was giving you a Five star rating I like this game much so give me a chance please please please !!!! im requesting you and Reminding you a thing that I Don't do anything but please Help me to Access this game on 30th Jan 15 . My Storm id is : shoeplanet . I will be very thankful to you and Please I want this game back !!! God bless you🌈 Please Send me a chance ! I will appericiate and I like teamlava games ! A lot and please till now I had not only cut the Star ratings coz I remember you will help me to access my game coz I had a very Too Nice shop !! God bless you and please help and I give it five star ratings coz I know that you're too Nice !!!!
3313	5	a	Brilliant game, please can we have more like this?
3314	1	a	Can't log in.. Asks me to check internet connection. VERY frustrating...
3315	5	a	It's good for what I need
3316	4	a	Forcing a regular password change for a locally stored in-app password makes about the same amount of sense as writing an internet banking in flash.  Fun facts from the password strength estimator:  'asdf' is a very weak password, but 'asdfasdf' is even weaker. 'tb1234' is a strong enough password (100 days rating). 'specikod222' is only slightly stronger (123 days). '#$\u0026_' is somewhere between (116). You guys ever heard about the entropy thing?
3317	5	a	I love this typ of games
3318	5	a	Works well but the blank SMS doesn't be saved in my messages application please fix .
3319	2	a	Not correct payout. Triple diamond with bar bar....?
3320	5	a	Easy and quick to find what I am looking for
3321	1	a	I hate this game. I want the old one back.
3322	4	a	..ive had widget for a week now,so far so good..does what it says on htc droid eris
3323	5	a	Super fun to play challenging and exciting
3324	1	a	Booo! Terrible waste of time.
3325	2	a	Black screen no menu or options guess it needs a menu button adding
3326	3	a	I like the concept, feels a little incomplete. Also, I got to level 11, but didnt get awarded the level 10 achievement...oh well...
3327	5	a	It took me a little while to get used to. But now I just love it. It has words by category, like any other app, but the main difference is that you can build a sentence as you think of it. Allowing you to learn words as you want to communicate! Excellent, excellent, excellent!
3328	4	a	Simple enough, good for tracking health stats. Yet to explore features \nfully. Useful app.
3329	5	a	Gives you confidence when you SEE with your own eyes that you can actually hit perfect bends.
3330	3	a	There's an add at the bottom of the screen which you press by accident. You have to pay $2 to remove. Also, after that this rate window comes up all the time. The game is a bit better than line runner 1
3331	5	a	It's great but can you add 2 things. First, make it so that we can play as the heros in another game mode. If that is add then also add a pvp as a hero and villain.
3332	5	a	The app gives really good information in a great way. Only thing I'd ask the development team is if they could add some sort of help menu? I didn't have a clue what half of it means. Still does what it's supposed to 👍 also if you could add some notification symbol next to the clock or something to actually tell me if I have signal or not coz it says 3G and 4G but don't seam accurate.
3333	5	a	" but not this excellent Cool 3D Gallery app."""
3334	3	a	But now on my Xperia Z5 it often doesn't connect back to my WiFi when I return home. It turns radio on, but no connection. Unsure if the phone or the app with Lollipop. Previous phone was HTC One M7 and this app was flawless on KitKat.
3335	5	a	I like this gam ....morever all the gams of dream up are very very good must try them ...
3336	2	a	" your EOS 6D full frame can't do what a $40 wifi card can??  Needs major work.  That said; it shows promise and works as remote..."""
3337	4	a	Ar mai trebui umblat la design, dar în rest este chiar ok
3338	5	a	Only downfall is that it makes me wanna. EAT chocolate ! Lol!
3339	5	a	Please guys let us know when the city upgrade will be available, which is long overdue!!! Just one thing drop the shotguns because they are utterly useless!
3340	1	a	Couldnt play it keept closing out
3341	1	a	I DON'T SPEAK THAT LANGUAGE
3342	5	a	ان هذا البرنامج في قمة الروعة
3343	1	a	All it did was display a black screen with Trace Complete.
3344	3	a	Let see how black looks on it
3345	1	a	ตั้งแต่มีโลโก้ nectec เข้ามาห่วยแตกมากไม่รีลไทม์ แถมขัดข้องบ่อย ภาพเคลื่อนไหวก็ห่วยแตก เทสกันมั้งมั้ยเนี่ย เพิ่มโลโก้มาก็เพิ่มประสิทธิภาพด้วยสิ
3346	5	a	This is a great app very descriptive. Explains everything simply and easily . Only wish 2 things. That it can be smaller or moved to SD.
3347	4	a	Great app. but just like to change reading version to another option would give it 5 Stars. Thx4 the app!
3348	5	a	This was a mains part of my work flow, and it was reliable, responsive and fast! If it wasn't for a new model camera so that it no longer works, I'd still be using it. The new app SUCKS SO BAD.
3349	4	a	Descent pics new ones unlocked ereday
3350	5	a	Switched careers,  non IT background, used this app as supplement to other online sources,  took the exam and passed.  This app is a great help.  Recommend for anyone preparing for sec plus.
3351	1	a	Very bad just waste money
3352	1	a	Useless since I changed my phone to a Huawei p20 lite. The spinning circle of doom. It is essential for me to check stock at my local branch when out and about to save a wasted journey, necessitating having to trail over there. On many occasions my trip has been wasted costing me valuable time and moneyand delays in completing jobs, to such a point that I no longer use toolstation. Clearly toolstation don't value their clients custom enough to maintain \u0026 develop their App, losing custom.
3353	4	a	This game is quite entertaining to play. I like the different modes that you can play. The dolphin and graphics are very cute as well. One improvement that could be made to this game is a shop where you can trade stars for things like powerups, costumes and dolphins
3354	2	a	When I'm having a migraine, it usually last 16 to 18 hrs but I wish that I can put the end date and time rather than try to calculate it myself - app should calculate for me. Also all my entries don't print out for my doctor; it only prints 1 month
3355	5	a	Does exactly what it says. Checks if Knox Status is Valid or Void.  IT CAN NOT CHANGE THAT STATUS!!! THAT'S BECAUSE SAMSUNG MADE THAT IMPOSIBLE TO DO!!!  If you break Samsung's warranty, then what YOU did is what trips the Knox Status to void. Once tripped it can NOT be set back to valid. This APP only LOOKS at what the status is, that's it. One of the things that SOMETIMES trips the status to Void is ROOTING your device. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The Plus version of this app also tells you if your device is rooted. The Possiblities ARE: Valid \u0026 Not-Rooted,  Valid \u0026 Rooted,  Void \u0026 Not-Rooted,  Void \u0026 Rooted.
3356	5	a	The application is fast and helpful for beginners like me.what is more remarkable is that  I am also able  to expand my vocabulary in Portuguese
3357	1	a	"Every time you disconnect the usb and reconnect it you have to \set up first\"" this involves going into the main system settings so this widget is a waste of time."""
3358	1	a	To hard to control the f*****g plane get it fixed or I will kill the creator of this game
3359	5	a	Well I do love cats so a cat themed diary and calendar is so me and I am obsessed with cats so this app is purrfect for me♥♥♥ Thank you for making this
3360	1	a	Can't get on to it can anyone help
3361	5	a	Best replacement for Action Memo for use with other launchers like Nova
3362	1	a	Boring wished u could give zero stars
3363	3	a	The maximum text characters when I switch to Spanish is very low. Like 50. I've looked and looked where to change this but can't find the setting. Anyone else have the same problem? Please please update if it's a glitch.
3364	1	a	Cum poti juca jocul asta daca nici macar nu este ca in imagini....nu apare verifica cuvant....mai e alta cale sa castigi?
3365	5	a	This is exactly what I've been looking for. Syncs with both calendar and evernote. Has an awesome interface, looks professional. Best to do app by far. THANKS to the developer
3366	5	a	Well, eventhough i don't understand japanese, but i like her cute voice. Will it be voice clock for IA?
3367	4	a	Easy to use on LG G3 and produces a good quality file. Would rate it 5 stars if the embedded browser saved the web page as displayed. Instead, it seems to obtain the content again from the URL for the save process - Which fails for sites that require a login, such as secured newsletters. Good app for public sites though and can also view the PDF quickly from within the app.
3368	5	a	it's jezzball, but better. haven't gotten past lvl 41 yet
3369	5	a	It is a bad game it gives your phone a.bad virus it stops it working an if you are on o2 and 3 and Virginia .it charge on your phone bill by 75% do not downloaded this game I wornd you?(will you lissen to me plz do)!!!!
3370	1	a	it is very bad application not worked
3371	5	a	Opent vlot en neemt weinig plaats in. Makkelijk in gebruik.
3372	5	a	But that's its only purpose but still awsome but it will not say when there is not a never fortress
3373	5	a	wow one of the best aap I ever seen such incredible app.well done sr keep it up
3374	1	a	login screen, clearly faulty. I tapped the Return User and it would NOT let me type my user. Make this app better PLS!!
3375	2	a	Only allows you to see app permissions but not manage them.  Facebook... 53 permissions, gives option to uninstall only.  Lame.  I uninstalled this and will look for a true permissions manager
3376	3	a	Cool app, need more designs, fun some time 3* - ill backup this to use. I think great usefull Message Photo (text). The zoom art lines i liked too. and Speaking baloons. _ :)
3377	1	a	I love every single thing about this game but it's got to be the laggest game I've ever played deleting the app due to it being so Laggy it's not even fun. Good concept tho. If the lag is fixed I will be playing non stop
3378	5	a	Geat app....I am addicted to it...
3379	5	a	Regardless of some minor issues that people may have with this,  due to not knowing how some features operate  ,  this app is amazing.  This will be my background for a long time,  I love the different backgrounds and effects.  It's also very useful that you can change the fps in order for it to work well on most devices,  I'm using a Moto E and I've yet to have a problem,  it doesn't drain your battery either.  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves space themed backgrounds.  I would be totally stoked if like a handful of other backgrounds and effects were added,  but I would also not complain if there isn't.  ,
3380	3	a	Works pretty well as a comprehensive conference guide, but not without some glaring shortcomings. The ability to schedule is great, but only reserved sessions can be added to the attendee schedule. Standby sessions cannot be added to the schedule, which means users have to constantly look up which sessions they want to wait in line to attend. Furthermore, sessions attended after standing in line on wait list don't appear in the user schedule, so there doesn't appear to be a way to provide feedback to speakers. Schedule time and location color is light gray on a white background? Really? I nearly went blind trying to read when and where sessions were happening.
3381	1	a	I JUST GOT THE BLACK SABERTOOTH AND THEN IT CRASHED MY TABLET AND BROKE AND I WAS AT QUEST 19!!!
3382	5	a	All good but needs some more UI improvements other than that I like it very useful and handy.
3383	1	a	It freezes up my phone all the time boring and to
3384	3	a	Its crashing from the 2nd time I strat the game.
3385	5	a	Best application ever! No permission required. Great job with this!
3386	1	a	I was about to use this to design my new house but this app is very complicated to use. I was happy when i first saw it but then its really complicated.
3387	2	a	It's gross when you run into someone, and it's really buggy, even when I use wifi. And you just run around running into everything. Kind boring
3388	1	a	In the picture above it tells that it will have a laser coming out from our phone but it doesn't don't know why we need to download
3389	4	a	Please update live darshan for full screen mode
3390	3	a	Same game as open world traffic racer...but still no good but they have the  same cars from burnin rubber 4 called Bullet350...but only different colours!
3391	5	a	Overall its really good and does let user easily choose size of icon and how transparent it is. Would be nice that besides giving the ability to edit it would either let the user know that the edit has been updated automatically or let the user hit save. Personally I think autosave will be smart cause users make mistakes. Can you add ability to rearrange the order of clip messages so when selecting multiple messages they can be pasted in the order user put them or sorted by time or sorted by time or date.
3392	3	a	" but there should be a white or black peg for that. And the maximum limit of 2 pegs of one color on hard is really annoying."""
3393	3	a	Καλη εφαρμογη ως ιδεα, αλλά αργεί πάρα πολύ και να φορτωσει τα αστεια, και να μετακινηθεί στα μενού... Αλλιως θα εδινα 4 αστερια.
3394	1	a	"It wont open it just says \unfortunately  looks like lacing shoe has stop\"" help plz i want tuff shoe laces"""
3395	3	a	Ads take over the whole screen.
3396	2	a	I didn't get link to apply
3397	5	a	Just what ive been looking for Thank you!
3398	5	a	Ever think of making a go launcher theme like this?
3399	5	a	This app is an extension. For those complaining about no contacts, it's already in the free app! When you swipe down, the 2 people silhouette icon is your contact list. The dialer is for actual dialing. It's only a dollar, so don't get angry. You paid for an expansion function.
3400	3	a	Would be nice if you could back-up/save the calls \u0026 text to a email acct like gmail, etc....
3401	5	a	Great app. Amazing people pit there out here for FREE just to help people cope better. Thank you so much.
3402	3	a	I like the game but it does not have enough levels.  Been waiting for new levels
3403	2	a	Why is deposit a check placed behind a + button? So non intuitive. Help \nmenu gives inaccurate location.
3404	5	a	It's good to drew I love i5
3405	5	a	It is easy fast and comprehensive tool..actually one of the best mobile app. It shows me in a flash everything I want to know about my package ,usage , charges and carryover. Only I would love to see last 6-12 months Bills. Currently last three. Month's bill only.
3406	1	a	It won't let me even play the game
3407	5	a	I really like the gameplay and how things were put into the game. The only thing I was thinking about is the update of new, I don't know, DLC or stuffs, events. I would like it to be like this but for most, the game is already a masterpiece
3408	2	a	I just downloaded it and when I go on it it crashes please fix thank you
3409	3	a	It is a good game for the racing lovers
3410	5	a	Grab your Doritos and mtn dew because this game will keep you playing for a \nlong time
3411	4	a	Easy to join pictures. Would be 5 stars if app had cropping option
3412	5	a	Çok kullanisli, gol kralligi, puan tablosu mac oynanirken guncelleniyor; super
3413	1	a	This doesn't even have to do with buttons at all!
3414	2	a	Controls are terrible, terrible, terrible
3415	5	a	the chase music is awsome
3416	5	a	great i liked it very cool. yassine
3417	1	a	Ring pas no don't download
3418	4	a	Please make the app to be able to access the SD Card that's where i save all my fonts, also let users choose their desired codes, maybe add a bookmark option or something, so we dont need to scroll back and forth just to view some characters, for example, in the basic latin area and private area. Its important for digital artists like me to work fast on everything. Thanks for this superb app! Add the features and I'll update my rating to 5 stars.
3419	4	a	I really like this app. It is formatted for progressive learning, not over burdened with advertising, and almost never locks up (that's a big plus). One critique, (need to be able to replay the sentence, when that red screen pops up in the listening section, would increase speed of learning)!!! Over all great app, looking forward to the full version when I am at that point.
3420	3	a	Good I like it to play
3421	5	a	I wanr to have this
3422	4	a	I like that the tip calculation split but let down to it's telling me that my currency is £ when it should be R. +++ Better to not show a currency or let the user choose. Still guessing the currency with latest version
3423	1	a	NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL. UNINSTALLED.
3424	2	a	Will let you buy a map tile and look at it. You can also draw lines crudely. And that appears to be it.  Can't print. Doesn't measure  accurately. You'll like it if your expectations aren't high,  but you'd be better off with paper. No batteries to fail on the hill and you can write on it.

3426	2	a	This would be a fine app, I suppose, but it works once then stops. I have to uninstall and reinstall it every time I want to listen. If I stop listening, the next time I open it, I see just the splash screen and nothing else happens. I guess I'll get my news from the web page instead.
3427	1	a	"It logs me out after 30 seconds or gets stuck \logging in\"" after I've already been using it for a few minutes. I wanted to look at my statements and it asked me to log in after I was logged in. online banking is so important. very disappointed."""
3428	5	a	Loved d tabs given on sides.
3429	5	a	It often repeats some pictures
3430	1	a	I install this application just to check it out, since I install itmy phone's been acting weird it has so much ad so many ad it's really annoying I'm sure you probably have the stuff you guys say probably on the paid version, I really don't need this kind things ,because I am not a high-profile person
3431	5	a	Nyc endless running game. It does not lag a bit. Since my device has a very low ram all games lag but this game is too good to play also it doesnt lag
3432	1	a	Nothing sounds like it should. I'm not sure what sounds they really trying to make but it's not a cat.  Even the whistle was weird.
3433	2	a	It's a member of the signs to recognize allah
3434	5	a	Iam pakistani and ilove my country it is natural effect like as indian love the india ilove to the indian people and respect there country and also expect they shoul do respect my country but clearly iwant to say here that ihate to the politician of india like moody indira wajpai and some of other r good but mody is the enemy of pakistan and pakistani people
3435	3	a	This game is okay, the only problem is that when you make a lot of beads you cant make any more and you have to delete some beads that you have made. The other thing is that WHY DO WE HAVE TO PAY REAL MONEY TO DO EARRINGS, NECKLACES AND A HEADBAND AND ONLY DO A BRACELET WHYYYY! At least you can watch a video and then have it for once or forever please make this situation be over PLEASE!
3436	4	a	This is very useful. Please keep updating more words to enrich the dictionary.
3437	5	a	Thank you! That system update thing was a headache for quite some time. Good job!
3438	4	a	quite impressive excellent game. 4 stars instead of 5 because later rounds have too many waves. level takes too long and you end up just adding and upgrading towers non stop defeat the purpose of td games. also buggy at times when you can't add or upgrade. overall very nice. needs improvement.
3439	2	a	Not really different from several other games just way more ad's. 3 opportunities to watch moves for coins before even playing then an addevery race. No thanks
3440	1	a	Not a capable of one star also...name given a laser light but it's flash light...do not use it
3441	5	a	I would love to b at this beach!
3442	5	a	waw so nice i am bless
3443	1	a	Honestly it's probably one of the worst games I've ever played. Giving it one star is still giving it way to much credit.
3444	1	a	Does not even worth to download
3445	4	a	I love it but it needs 95.5 :-D
3446	4	a	This would be perfect if you could make a title for the list you make and of course enable more lists. Still keeping it super simple of course, if that's possible. ;) As it is now, I use the first entry as my title and put it in caps, then when  I create a new list I put that in caps to distinguish the separation of the list. And if I need to add on to the first list, I just enter it and drag it up the line to where I want it. VOILA!
3447	2	a	I have this setup to use the Dual Meq15BT for my boat. It works great when the boat is turned off but starting the engine or accelerating shuts off the bluetooth connection. I checked all connections and tested power with multimeter. When starting the engine voltage drop to @10.5 volts. This immediately shuts down the system. Likewise when a celerating voltage spikes to 1t.5 volts and shut down bt. I've called support and they are useless. They make bad marine products. Highly advise to stay away from Dualav equipment and software
3448	4	a	Great skin but it needs an update now as it won't get applied with the latest version of power amp
3449	4	a	Let's you fix any little mistakes you make and the button is within the menu so you will never press it on accident.
3450	4	a	Great app. Would change one thing...image switching.  Focus on one or two images during the chanting would be less distracting.  Thank you for the app🐺
3451	5	a	Ever think you are better than somebody else, when somebody write something if you dont undertand asking a question ask to explain what that means, that was wrote depend of the subject we was treated on at that moment.
3452	4	a	Its easy to use nothing huge to figure out. My only thing is, its 9am n the new readings for today are not updated n there is no respondes in the responsorial psalm yesterday
3453	4	a	This application useful for English learner
3454	1	a	After downloading the resources whenever I launch the game it only opens for a split second and then it says that gun bros has stopped. I had this game on a different older device and it worked great but now I can't even play it. I would rate it 5 stars if it worked.
3455	5	a	It keep saying it's stopped plz fix other then that awesome game
3456	2	a	"Galaxy S7: OK at first, now whenever I try to launch it, it just states \Loading\"" but never opens anymore. Very disappointing."""
3457	4	a	I love it , Beautiful
3458	5	a	Really Really awesome and good
3459	1	a	Laggy, dull, why did someone waste my time releasing This?
3460	5	a	One of the best busybox options out there.
3461	4	a	Would be so much better if there were questions for other countries too.
3462	5	a	It's simple, you can learn the controls in about 5 seconds. Then it's easy. Finding animals is like blinking. Last of all its fun.
3463	1	a	Hey I just downloaded this app but whenever I open it asks me about a user name and password I just don't know how to login any help please!!!
3464	1	a	This game is terrible don't waste your space on this game it has a lot of good text I'll give them that but you can take it with out some notification coming up and say unfortantly this app isn't working right now and some crap and honestly it gets on my nerves so bad if you get this game then good luck to ya
3465	5	a	Such a nice game we can play it anywhere anytime any place please download this game such a nice game

3470	4	a	Nice game  but sometime bad conection cant play game
3471	4	a	Got a chain of number and text, cant use it... I know its Samsung security issue. But its good app
3472	1	a	This was my all time favourite game but now it just stalls or frezzes all the time ,its so frustrating ,please help !
3473	3	a	Good app but box 6 is missing.
3474	1	a	Vegas Bing, how can you win when you only get 5 or 6 numbers \u0026 I'm playing. 4 card's
3475	3	a	The nails you can only use one pack.
3476	5	a	Ever since I started using this App I have improved my analysis towards mathematics. I assure you that if you start using this App you will indeed increase your math skills. :D
3477	5	a	I love this app because I kiss in the lips to
3478	2	a	Used this briefly when I first started to study for the NASM CPT. I don't recommend it. Questions were harder than NASM, some to the point of being confusing, and I noticed in the explanations a lot were based on an old version of the text. I used the NASM text and tools in the study and passed 1st try. This app wasn't worth the time and headache.
3479	5	a	Nice game..it's full of excitement to play this game.
3480	1	a	This game is very boring do not install
3481	3	a	I think it was not realistic and it wad a slow process for installing it!
3482	1	a	Worst app. I can't login to the correct number. Even the support team can't \nhelp. We tried a lot of things. This is not user friendly and not reliable. \nI might end up putting my money in a wrong account so i decided not to use \nit. Even web portal is not working. Not recommended.
3483	1	a	Get lost looking money to open the app
3484	5	a	its slow but its ok
3485	4	a	1) Warum kann man die Location nicht in Maps aussuchen?   2) gps Koordinaten in Maps nicht gefunden - da hängt Datenmüll dran (Teile des Namens)  3) Warum werden Favoriten gelöscht wenn man die Position ändert?  4) Bitte eine 2.Position für die Distanzberechnung. (Mittelpunkt des Aktionsradius !\u003d aktuelle Position) default:  beide Positionen identisch. Alternativ: aktuelle Position (grob-WiFi)
3486	1	a	"This game could be amazing. However its not! Its very easy to get stuck at a point where you have no choice but to pay real money to get out of a hole. Clearly just a cash cow and very little interest taken to make it a \good\"" game."""
3487	1	a	Doesn't work with current android version
3488	1	a	This should not be on here shows for 2011... Needs updating please!
3489	4	a	I've been looking for a Spider game which has a dark theme like this game. I LOVE the theme. I will be able to play in bed without disturbing my partners!  Is there going to be a paid version to get rid of the ads? Also,  I would like to see a 'replay' option and a landscape option.   A.
3490	5	a	Excellent, magnifique! Je suis enchanté avec la lésion.
3491	3	a	Is there a way to delete demo sites from the list?
3492	5	a	Include a village finder and I'll buy it for sure!
3493	5	a	it  is very nice app correct calculate
3494	5	a	Works perfectly on my Moto Kinzie XT1580, L5.1.1.  I used to use AOSP navbar mod with Xposed framework on Xperia devices which was unreliable at times, this app is a far better UI and gives much more control over individual key modifications. Even gravitybox hooks are unaffected and shortcuts still work perfectly. Well worth the price, thanks for your work!
3495	1	a	I understand why special features, like the shooting star effect, are \nwalled off from the free version. BUT WHY WOULD YOU NOT ALLOW US TO TURN \nOFF THE DOUBLE-TAP TRIGGER FOR THE SETTINGS!? It's just purposefully \nannoying and inconvenient, which is a shame because it really is a \nbeautiful wallpaper. But not worth it. I thought I could just ignore the \nsettings acting like a persistent pop-up ad but I can't. It is infuriating. \nOne Star.
3496	2	a	I played for a few minutes and it crashed. It's too simple and boring.
3497	5	a	Its work with my Isuzu dmax 2.5 car audio system. No intefrence when using bluetooth speaker for phone calling
3498	4	a	Would gladly buy an ad free version.
3499	1	a	Really bad I cannot read anything on the game. doesn't make sense and all control do not work
3500	5	a	I finally submitted to a update for this app. Great free app. The game is satisfying to play.
3501	5	a	Very very nice app. \u0026 easy to use
3502	3	a	It was fun(rage inducing) for a while, but got boring/numbingly annoying as it got too difficult.. We need checkpoints, or some kinda of options to make it easier before I, along with many others, resume playing again. I hope to see an update sometime in the next month or I will delete this game for good
3503	1	a	It just wouldn't work I tried very hard so I just gave up
3504	5	a	These are so great. I can gaze at each for a long period of time, and it has a way of plucking all of the negative vibes once attached to me. Its like having pictures of what our souls are made of. Lol. Im aware that i sound like a major hippy right now, but I don't mind,.cuz my description is accurate.  ;-)
3505	1	a	When ever i hit something it won't let me walk in any other direction...
3506	2	a	Since update I cannot clip coupon, when logged in as a guest I see the \ncoupon but when I login no coupon can be found. My gas rewards also do not \nshow up. Please fix.
3507	5	a	7 and half app nice app
3508	5	a	In almost all aspects this is better than papyrus and lecture notes, bookmarking, rule eraser and add space are great options. However, only drawback I see is that there is no option to type text. This ability to switch between typing and handwriting is present in all the other tablets  EDIT !!! Guys any of you having problem with not having cloud storage use app dropsync. it automatically syncs your backup folder in sd card with dropbox.
3509	5	a	Passed today, this app was the best resource I had, and the style of \nquestions closely emulated those of the exam. An excellent app.
3510	4	a	Thanks to the team who made this apps...
3511	5	a	LOVE this app! Not only does it tell you where the camera lights are it gives you the speed limit wherever you are which is nice since some places I honestly didn't know due to lack of signs. It beeps if I go over the speed limit which is nice if there's a cop in the area you are instantly aware without looking down of your speed but the best feature is the camera. I have my phone right on a windshield holder and I can record from trips. Instant dash cam!
3512	5	a	Helps keep me mentally awake
3513	3	a	Problem is the emf doesn't work well when compared to a utesla meter.  If that is fixed, 5 star app, id say.
3514	1	a	Its to hard to cpntrol the car
3515	1	a	It totally do work, yo. I tried it and it cut out my face, AND my eyes! I looked like a ghost! Totally try something different
3516	1	a	All my value in card gone. Balance show zero
3517	2	a	ตอนนี้ปี 2561 แต่มีข้อมูลวิเคราะห์ปี 2559 เข้ามาใน Alert Box \nสร้างความสับสนอย่างมากครับ...
3518	1	a	Does not work, it crush every time
3519	2	a	seriously, there will a be a notification popping out saying that there's an error every single minute. getting sick of it
3520	1	a	What happened to the rue morgue store on the app?
3521	4	a	Don't know what it is
3522	2	a	In lecture session has some bugs? It shows different question.
3523	1	a	Don't know what u do on this machine so confused don't like it :(
3524	2	a	After applying the effect on the photo you should provide erasing option that which part of the pic we want to erase we can erase by that option.it  means which area i want to remain the original that can be remain original after applying and erasing.just like pixlr. Please improve it as early you can. Thank u
3525	2	a	It has withdrawn my favorite category section of wallpapers...not \nhappy...😪😪
3526	1	a	Har måtte stå og vente sammen med en kontrollør flere gange, imens jeg prøver at få den her lorte app til at virke... Det skal fixes!!!
3527	3	a	NEVER put loud advertising in a game. 'Sometimes' we don't want others to know what we are up to.
3528	5	a	its very good game for racing lovers,please i request kairo to make the intense version free.
3529	5	a	"Excellent basic \radio\"" face! I wish it also had a date too. Maybe they \ncould add it in the future."""
3530	5	a	Didn't know Radio Caroline was still around. Awesome
3531	1	a	scant den Code 4 mal ohne resultat und dann stürzt die app ab
3532	5	a	My cousin loves this game
3533	5	a	My personal favorite cleaning, boosting, all around helpful app in the play \nstore. Try the pro version 😉
3534	1	a	It's just waste of time for sure
3535	5	a	Been using this app for over five years.  Works every time.
3536	3	a	Twice my battery died while playing and the backup system failed both times and I lost all progress. The second time I was 5 maps away from 4 stars on all maps. I wasn't far in the first time so it was no big deal to catch up. Great game but I'm not making up all that time.
3537	5	a	Very good jesa muje chahiye tha vesa aap ne banaya he ye app
3538	3	a	Meget fin app. Kunne eventuelt også køres sammen med data fra hjertestarter.dk. Og så er det ret skidt at man ikke kan se ventetider på akutklinikker i region H, men er nødt til at ringe til 1813
3539	5	a	People who made this game i want you to update it and have a English mode on it please do this
3540	1	a	It seems to me that a successful app means it is actually FUNCTIONAL! Trying to check my account transactions on a Friday afternoon shouldn't take over a half hour. On top of that, all I get is a message on the screen saying there is a problem. Fix the stupid app.
3541	5	a	It an AWESOME game also the control are great I hope they keep making more and I hope the make the next game soon, but could they make optional routes instead of only K
3542	3	a	It's OK. The buzzer is cool but the sound is wrong
3543	5	a	נכון הui לא מדהים וחסרים מלא פיצ׳רים כמו יכולת לסדר מועדפים לפי כיוון נסיעה לדוגמא אבל עדיין עושה את העבודה בפשטות. מעדיף על מווביט ואחרות בז׳אנר
3544	5	a	Very good app. Love the graphics
3545	3	a	tell me how to record or add this option if its not yet available?
3546	5	a	Really helpful u should get it
3547	2	a	You can't even change the controls
3548	5	a	5 stars for the epic review replies from the dev! Crybabies don't understand free software haha.
3549	5	a	Nice game there should be more car
3550	1	a	Daca iti place aceasta aplicatie esti cel mai valoros/a si sefu la toti banii, fa asa: fa rost de doua cuie valoroase de aprox. 10 cm, da drumul la muzica ta preferata si la aplicatie apoi ia cate un cui in fiecare mana si introdu-le simultan in proza masinii de spalat. Sa vezi ce bonusuri valoroase iti baga ;) !!!!!
3551	5	a	Its nice but not great only average
3552	3	a	My pup loves the game its hilarious BUT wish it had a 5 or 10 minute lock screen cause she plays on tablet n her paws stay on screen sometimes and it exits  ....
3553	1	a	This app dosent do nothing it is sappose you to do it gives you bad stuff \ndont get it
3554	5	a	I just love baby hazel games
3555	4	a	It is good game, my boy play every day but in this game background sounds off opation not available.
3556	5	a	This app has everything I could want in a dice app.  customizable dice (Number rolled, how many sides, modifiers, etc)  No ads: probably the best part, and what pushed my over the edge to donate as well  Import and Export Feature:  A very nice, very convenient feature  Dice Log: Every convenient when you need to reference rolls for more than just the roll you are doing now.   Overall, one of the best apps I have, and the only app I have put in a review for.
3557	2	a	Description says I can edit pages in free version, but no information is given on how to do that. Also no information on how to upgrade from free version.  It has been an okay test app to use with my students, but frustrating in its limitations.   Also volume is still to low.
3558	4	a	Too easy, but fun for a quick rush
3559	3	a	It's  a  bit  boring  but  l  like   it👌😉😐
3560	4	a	It should appear on screen like that of Xperia z or sp please make it like that that would be more helpful.. And perfect
3561	4	a	"The new sensitivity feature is note quite refined enough for implementation. Anything over 1 makes the spirit guy jump all over the place. I think the \base line\"" sensitivity needs to be MUCH lower which may allow the higher settings to be more practical/usable."""

3569	5	a	Surreal voice.good work always  will be with loads of blessings and ajar.thank you brother.
3570	5	a	I use it everyday at the breakfast table. Easy to use, navigate, browse, share and modify. An app like it oughta be.
3571	2	a	First one was better. This one is very glitchy and kind of annoying.
3572	2	a	Could not use it as there is no zoom option.....
3573	1	a	Paid and got a refund, but could not downloadthis app on my kids samsung kids tab. Kept coming uo with error code:500 I followed all processes to try and get it to work. The eggy 100 hd works tho
3574	4	a	Este o aplicatie super, numai ca mie nu imi apar pozele cu indicatoarele. Am dat update si tot nu imi apar pozele :(
3575	2	a	This app used to work no problem with my Xperia Z5 Premium and Xperia Z4 tablet. However, now any time I try and connect them it says device not found. Useless.
3576	1	a	You can only get four levels and you dont  even get to see the baby. This game is lame unless you buy it. Good luck playing this game.
3577	5	a	I wish there was relative or suggested values. I used it to mitigate static coming from my headphones by lowering the headphone field to 50. It worked great.
3578	5	a	Um its a game of levels you must go through a maze thing to get to your baby
3579	5	a	I love it it's the best one
3580	4	a	I have to an extent satisfactory experience while using this app..
3581	1	a	Cute but wont let u apply...
3582	5	a	Simple and it works well
3583	5	a	Man I spent so much time trying to get this. didn't think it'd be in the market. i'm an idiot.
3584	5	a	بلی عاشق این برنامه هستم
3585	3	a	Çevrimdışı çalışma özelliğide olsa iyi olur
3586	4	a	"A pretty good app.. But had issues with some barcodes/movies \not existing\"" \nmaybe time for an update as ive found about 20 or so of my anime box sets \nthat apparently dont exist and are the us/can releases"""
3587	3	a	The app runs a bit slow (none of my other apps do) and it would be really nice to know what the correct answer is and why, so you can learn and not just have to guess next time that question comes up.
3588	3	a	it used to be good but the latest update is  problematic and full of errors, instant uninstall
3589	5	a	Amazing app about culture. The pictures and description are both wonderful. It's not a calendar, but a introduction about weather (not accurate description, it's better to say it something related to weather and time)
3590	5	a	Love it good game but the problem is that it down loads slow
3591	4	a	I LOVE this app. It's super simple and functional. I just really really wish the color picker and opacity bar had input boxes so I could match color/opacity across all my notes. It looks so messy when they don't match and it makes me crazy. Please add this feature!!
3592	5	a	My kids adore the monkey (I bought also Kids Shape Puzzle for Toddlers with Abby monkey). The pictures are wonderful and the app works without problems. Really fun for kids. Please make more great apps like this!!
3593	3	a	Good otherwise but it runs my phone EXTREMELY hot. I can't use the actual tabletop view for longer than an hour without my full battery being drained. On a Motorola X 2nd gen Pure edition. I'm hoping it's just a bug, I'll try it on my tablet later.
3594	5	a	I just got this so i don't know yet...😬
3595	3	a	Pedometer doesn't work yet, but it's still in beta testing. The ads are intensely annoying and intrusive, come on when you least expect, with volume.
3596	5	a	This app is like Canadian cigar facebook wall. I love it! Nice guys, cool pics and nice ideas for future cigar purchases on what to try
3597	5	a	É o mais preciso. Outros apps mostram carros que nem estão circulando, pois está fora do horário. Bus Finder não erra nisso.
3598	4	a	Tried to download the extra levels for 0.62p but it won't verify my CVC yet I have my card right here and the money to pay for it so I know it's not that.
3599	4	a	All the emulators work great; so far I've tested the gameboy, gameboy advance, super nintendo, nintendo 64 and the playstation emulators. All work great, no dropped frames. My only complaint is the lack of support for my Moga pocket controller. Maybe I'm just being thick, but I can't figure out how to make it connect at all. If they can make that work, five stars. Well worth the money. Tested on my note 3.
3600	5	a	I clearly dont see whats wrong with this app. It works perfectly! What may help for improvement is to stop the lag of the app.
3601	4	a	Scanned library well for displaying media but cannot launch VLC player.  An error comes up and closes VLC.  VLC will play same media directly.
3602	4	a	I find the application very useful. However, if it could include phonetic \ntranscription it would be great.
3603	3	a	Good content, but horrible UI.  This app is not what they show in the pictures. It's a single chain of memes that you scroll down through. Even worse, if your phone changes from portrait to landscape, the app doesn't remember where you were; instead, it takes you all the way to the top. Another issue I have is that the download button seems to have stopped working. The developers give you a message when you open the app promising a full version; but, I've had this app for 2 months and I've seen no changes.
3604	4	a	Been using GasRecord for sometime... Great app!
3605	3	a	Swipe doesn't seem to work.  It also crashes a lot sometimes I have to restart my phone or it won't respond.
3606	1	a	This app is recognised as MALWARE by AVG antivirus PRO. Please don't download this app.
3607	1	a	this this is so brillyent there so many games and i love it it is the best think ever

3610	1	a	I cannot even pay my first bill after enrollment to this App because the online payment i use (GCASH) option does not work... 2nd, you cannot find the PDF version of the bill because it says that the online registration was done after the bill was generated. duhh... 3rd, additional 1.25% of the bill is being charged for the payment partners??? Hello.... previous payment method does not collect additional fees. whats the benefit of enrolling to this app? its a hassle and cost more?
3611	5	a	I love the music and the choice of stations. Thankyou for this app
3612	3	a	When ever you scroll up down left right there's these annoying  white blocks  please fix this
3613	4	a	She was about 18 months when I got it. She still plays it. Although it's getting a bit simplistic now. She gets bored with it quickly.
3614	5	a	Its a great app. If you want to uninstall it, just deactivate it from the Management section in your phone. Easy.
3615	5	a	Graphics are much better too:D
3616	5	a	I have nothing to say.
3617	5	a	Really impressive App with the most useful Widget that instantly provides \nall the relevant information for my local tidal area. Tidal Diagrams are \nbasic, but give much needed information. Looking forward to the French \nports being included. Getting better \u0026 better with every update. \nTechnophobes might struggle, but sailors with any aptitude for IT will love \nthis app. The best tide app by far. Still waiting for the French data, \nnevertheless, definitely the best tidal app for the UK.
3618	1	a	Unable to installed,after 100%downloaded completed,it started again from 1%,continuously trying for twodays,the bad and stressful app in the market
3619	4	a	It could add news over the summer break
3620	5	a	This app is perfect. I use it most days and makes productivity so much \neasier. The only thing i would like to see is the ability to save or sync \nyour notes to some sort of cloud storage just in case our phones break or \ngo missing . Thanks for this app. Its a gem
3621	5	a	The energy bar is very short but the game is like that  I am in a war. But all the enemies only attack me and after some time  I see that my hero is lying on the ground. Even though , this game is very fun and addictive.
3622	5	a	Cool movement as a live wallpaper I like the banner that is moving and the birds too
3623	1	a	Controls are horrible, everything is slow, no tutorial, etc. One of the worst games you could play. Wish I could rate 0 stars.
3624	2	a	So, after uninstall. U can force kill the locker and sneak into personal info. I wuld increase rating if this is fixed.
3625	2	a	I hate getting a creeper on my screen it is so irritating...fix that and I'll fix my rating
3626	3	a	Its good but work slowly
3627	4	a	but it do not cover my whole screen just a tad bit . but its a good game htc amaze.
3628	5	a	It's the best football game in my whole it's kinder better than Madden mobile
3629	5	a	Hare Krishna! Thank you... perfect. Jai Prabhupada Jai Jagad Guru Srila Prabhupad...
3630	4	a	Once you've finished this you'll be ready for Voxel Invaders. Just like the original arcade games there are no instructions, so you work it out as you play. Basically, if it moves, shoot it!
3631	5	a	Jai hind.Pakistan murdabad tha hai aur rahega. Hum indiawale bap hai Pakistan ke. Is liye apni aukat me raho.
3632	3	a	Decent but so many ads.
3633	5	a	Level 47 is so hard im still stuck on it
3634	1	a	Bcoz it gives advertisements on mobile screen during using this app...
3635	3	a	Well.. you can't just leave the game if it's not as successful as you hope for. This game has great potential, you guys just needs more time fixing and adding stuff to this.. i still have my hope in this game, therefore in you guys as well:)
3636	4	a	Take sabar rasanya menanti bulan December INI.insyaAllah.
3637	5	a	I like this much better than sms popup which was leaving notifications up after reading them. However it seems to be duplicating each msg in popup
3638	1	a	La use y mejaron esperando una hora con este frio me mandaron uno y nunca llego me resfrie y todo eso not sirve es muy mala calida
3639	1	a	The game itself is still great, port is ok. But, major bugs, preventing me from finishing the game, after 26+ hours put into it. Seriously. Wish I could get a refund. Two companions gone missing (not from the story, just bugged), planets resetting, conversations cancelling so I can't continue. I can't continue the main quest on the last planet because the conversation is broken?!! What do I do now?
3640	5	a	This is n nice nd awesome game i give it 10 star but there is only space of 5 star
3641	5	a	Absolutny must-have przy korzystaniu z usług luxmed. Ułatwia wszystko i \ndaje dodatkowe możliwości w porównaniu z kontaktem telefonicznym.
3642	1	a	I have no idea why or how y'all like it but it stinks
3643	3	a	I like the app but some of the function don't work, i would only recommend this to beginner digital artist
3644	5	a	This game has got epic stunts
3645	4	a	I think it is a fun game you can play when you're bored. It's great in terms of puzzle solving and the levels are EZ to figure out so you can progress a lot faster.
3646	4	a	Good collection of questions. Nice app only one thing is missing, more categories of questions are required.
3647	1	a	This app loads up to a black screen with the name of the app in the top left corner and proceeds no further. I have tried different phones to load this game and ended up with the same results. 😤
3648	5	a	Gud wrk guys. All d best!!
3649	2	a	Only works part of the time.  Caller's in the blacklist still get to voice mail most of the time. I try to add the number to my blacklist, and it says number already exists.  Disappointing!
3650	1	a	Does not work ? Soooo wats the point
3651	1	a	This app used to be nice. I could check my data usage, account balance \u0026 renew my service through it.  Now it does not work at all! It has said cannot connect for months!  I won't be surprised if Iwireless goes under and our phones stop working!
3652	3	a	Great sound but Too many ads..
3653	5	a	Good but airplane mode doesn't work at redmi 3 pro.
3654	5	a	Worked perfectly for my purposes, makes it real easy to colour in sketches on my tablet. And y'all worrying about it showing up black, don't worry, it's just a transparent PNG. Open it in a drawing program and it'll show up fine
3655	1	a	Have not been able to play this game, it always say it unfortunately stopped. Please fix or refund my money.
3656	1	a	My but is better than this crap.
3657	1	a	Total waste of time do not download it doesnot even open and say \nunfortunately stopped
3658	1	a	Now level 9 is impossible,  the easter level is bullcrapping me out of wins, and prices are absurd. Do not get this. The lack of adds is the only good thing.  Only headshots count in this game and even when you can see the bolt on the first gun(which uses a red dot fir a telescopic sight) the devs thought it would be semi automatic
3659	3	a	App is good but lots of proverbs are missing, ਅੰਨਾ ਮਾਰੇ ਅੰਨੀ ਨੂੰ ਘਸੁੰਨ ਵੱਜੇ ਥੰਮੀ ਨੂੰ ਹੋਰ ਵੀ ਕਈ
3660	2	a	This app don't work his fake but it's fun cool
3661	2	a	You should be so embarrassed to advertise another game the way you do in this game.  Do you think we are so stupid as to not know to download another game if we want?  Leave it up to your customers to choose without cramming down our throats-you are ruining you own company.
3662	1	a	This is the most rediculous kindergarten game ever. This game is perfect for 1 -2 year olds. I would highly not suggest downloading it.
3663	4	a	Its quite impressive but weird:)
3664	2	a	had to uninstall this game, tried and tried but everytime i get a bonus while playing tournament it will go blank and won't come back losing all my winnings..did not work on this new phone Samsung galaxy J7...maybe next phone
3665	3	a	Its OK I have fun with it helps me learn a little more the cards work but the link to the one you buy pops up all the time really is annoying
3666	4	a	It's good, as frustrating as the original game. Doesn't keep high scores up but
3667	5	a	nee gudha la moda send xnxx videos
3668	1	a	Shite  dont get enough free chips  worst poker on play store
3669	5	a	For the cancerous crap this is, it's freaking amazing. MLLLGGGG 4200 NOSCOPPPEEEE OOOHHGGHHHHH
3670	5	a	i like this game nice halloween😊😊😊
3671	2	a	It's weird dam boring just for fun u can play it but u get d same question several times
3672	5	a	IVE NEVER SEEN SOMETHING SO UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT. I'M REALLY ENJOYING IT
3673	5	a	Helpful to do some analysis with tracking data
3674	4	a	Example: Download today for 100 gems valued at $13.Only to install and find out it is 200 gems, for less than a  worth of $2. Some may argue they made a mistake and tried to make up for it, but it was still a huge money lie that convinced many people to download.
3675	2	a	Tried to get into the story, but people who have played longer and have better ships prey on news so I can't complete a single mission without being killed multiple times. Not fun.
3676	5	a	I love all the baby hazel games .... then what special to say about this ?? :)
3677	3	a	It is a good app but some formulae were wrong
3678	4	a	I like the evolutions could be better at giving more stars tho
3679	1	a	Couldn't play so uninstalling. Not happy
3680	5	a	I love this app because when I press it all the fruits come and it is really cool it is like you have all control....... Overall this app is awesome👏👏👏💞💞😊😊😂😂
3681	2	a	So yeah no. I got the same location for every phone number tried. Not \nhating it but not loving it either.
3682	4	a	" but I recommend the \""manual\"" mode to get an accurate tune."""
3683	1	a	Chưa thấy chỗ nào bán giá trên trời như ở đây. Thử mở app lên check giá 1 sp xong rồi xoá vĩnh viễn
3684	1	a	Converted files ok but never managed to play a file.. Deleted
3685	5	a	I absolutely love this app!!! I get cash back for shopping online when I use their app!!!!! So easy and awesome since I was going to buy the products anyway.
3686	3	a	The game needs alot of improvements.  When i say that i mean that the options need to be expanded into different available game play modes(difficulty), graphics(high/low),  and last but not least, is adding the ability to invert y axis on control layout.  Its so much easier to shoot in any game with inverted  y axis.  If this one feature is added then i will retype this rating review and post 5 stars! Faster that feature gets added then the faster you get 5 stars from me! If not soon then i will uninstall.
3687	1	a	Did not work on my rooted Xperia Z2
3688	5	a	Same as simon,lots of fun. This way its at least smaller than a small table!
3689	1	a	This app doesn't work with my LG V10 and just closes when I try to play or record anything.
3690	5	a	This is so cool i can make may own song using this, i wish i had a pads
3691	5	a	its awesome but what ever happened to the multiplayer version,was much better
3692	1	a	It's a waste of time!
3693	3	a	Needs to have car stunts like backflips or frontflips or anything like stunts
3694	4	a	Nice little app. Still a good few films that need to be added to the database
3695	1	a	Very bed without buy u cant see. Do not install it is fake
3696	1	a	Ads every 2 second, garbage
3697	5	a	"The best melody generator.....please add the \surprise me\"" button on the paid version."""
3698	4	a	It is very very nice application ....mujhe kuch bahut ni aata tha ...mene is app se bahut kuch seekha hai ..or mai is app ko share bhi krta hu un dosto ko jinki english kamjor hai ....bahut acha app hai
3699	1	a	Got it lods of adds and it did not respond
3700	5	a	I tried several of these apps with no luck until I found this one. Brilliant!
3701	5	a	Very very pretty I really really Love Teddy bears.
3702	5	a	Excellent app, have been using on and off for many years.
3703	5	a	True live wallpaper with great minimal material design! Free version is good, but I think I'll buy the pro for extra features!
3704	1	a	You could do better effects with Preview on a Mac book. Dose not let you adjust where the effect will be placed, you can only adjust the opacity of it. You only get to choose from like 20 effects for free, that's low even for a free app. Do not download
3705	1	a	Doesn't work on Note 8. It says loading, but it doesn't load anything
3706	2	a	None user friendly app. Needs lot of improvment . Thanks for working on it but still have much to do
3707	1	a	I played the whole game long time ago n finished all the levels for they were all free. Now I wanted my son to play it to see it's not free any more. I would like to give 5 stars but for this reason I would give only one star...
3708	5	a	Addictive Game, really loved it. I liked it not requiring extra permissions, Job well done.
3709	3	a	Not opening this game properly.try to improve as soon as possible
3710	5	a	The best ever shopping list. I was using this list more than 3 years. Easy to monitor what ever thing you want to buy
3711	4	a	It repeats the same questions but not all the time u really need to know ur disney trivia
3712	5	a	I love this game and its simple design. Its grown popular with the kool kids klub and is pretty fun I'm general.
3713	1	a	I go to open the app it show a black screen then goes back to my main screen. Please fix this
3714	2	a	Even though I have sharing enabled, it doesn't get the data from My Tracks, which is the entire point. Otherwise, a very basic, straightforward app.
3715	5	a	I have a specific condition which makes reading difficult for me so using colour tints is vital, this enables me to use my phone just like everyone else. Thank you!!
3716	2	a	I can't make a new animation .. I re-tried so many times.
3717	5	a	"\Great app. plz make apps for reading as well\"""""
3718	5	a	Saves my lot of money
3719	1	a	I can handle the advertisements but not the French. Uninstalling.
3720	5	a	Worth having it. Simple better user interface.
3721	1	a	Noons is even on its horrible do not play I repeat do not play this game
3722	1	a	if you want to watch ads,its a perfect game
3723	5	a	Im not sure why people go to North Korea or hiking in Iran or mountain climbing in Pakistan but they should get this app first before they do something that stupid.
3724	5	a	I think all the children love the game
3725	3	a	Guys life-like painting nails and you're like the total painting nail freak and you would love this game you at all yesterday I can buy any designs on it however many you want and you could decorate V Nails you could take a picture of your nails of your hand and you could you could paint your hand except the other hand for real life the game thank you for reading this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! English news flash um you can you can do this out without any internet
3726	1	a	This stupid app updated and now it completely locks about half the time I \npush pause on my headset, then requires a complete reboot to get it to work \nagain. Guess I'll switch to something that's not so buggy.
3727	1	a	It won't let me play
3728	1	a	Simplesmente não funciona. Diz que no meu número Le Club já está sendo \nutilizado. Desinstalando esse lixo de App. Desativem essa vergonha ou \natualizem totalmente!
3729	5	a	Great free app, couldn't pay for one that would be better...thank you
3730	1	a	Would've loved to rate higher but can't add sd card as file source, 1 star until issue resolved
3731	1	a	Why is this available in English speaking play?
3732	2	a	Nothing like that on my Text display looks like this one.
3733	2	a	How can you like something that doesn't work? Unless you download another program you pay for. But then again, who knows if it will work even then?
3734	5	a	It's actually quite good, I like it!
3735	2	a	The main objective of downloading this app was to get notifications about Tithi. The app doesn't give any notifications. Can you please resolve it ASAP?
3736	3	a	Efeito muito legal, ruim como fundo das ícones - Melhor seria se fosse um app de criar imagens panorama e exibir o efeito. Ou... se desse um BLUR no fundo e um pequeno AUTO-Movment. - Por enquanto, deletei, pois não pretendo usar. #FicaADica de melhorar esta app como fundo. Note: Não é exatamente um LIVE wall... é um SCROLLABLE wallpaper. 3*
3737	2	a	Needs some more bugs fixed and a few changes. Balance doesn't carry forward, can't enter negative amount, and some envelopes only have the option to change the name not actually enter a transaction in the envelope
3738	1	a	Don't know how it got 4 stars
3739	5	a	This app is what I need ;)
3740	1	a	I downloaded it but it doesnt work on my s3 mini...tried downloading it twice but it still the same
3741	5	a	So good! I could never find scary stories for free, but then I found this! Its like a whole 500 page book of them!😊
3742	3	a	Really nice to do function, but without the ability to have a task repeat, it's not a functional tool for me.... But it has huge promise! Please keep improving the customization options (repeat task,  color options for due date) and you'll have a 5-star app!
3743	1	a	sracka, par mesiacov som to nepoužíval ale uz nic jako zmizla moznost pozret si qr letenky v apke, treba si nechat poslat mail s letenkou, samozrejme sa ani neda nastalo prihlasit ze by som mal prehlat letov...neviem aky blb to navrhol ale ak ste za toto niekomu platili, to znaci ako cela csa funguje
3744	5	a	Great Game !!! I think this is a very challenging and addicting game because it's very hard to past each challengers. I must spend a lot of time for it, but I completely love it. You should try it
3745	4	a	I used to play this long time ago and unfortunately I forgot how to play it's a good thing they had a tutorial it helped get the cobwebs out of my mind and I was able to play it once more... Don't you love these games that make you actually use your gray matter
3746	1	a	Jeg savner at sige den kun skal vise de biografer jeg går i, så 1) Jeg ikke har en liste med en masse biografer jeg alligevel ikke går i.  2) Når jeg kigger hvor der går en film, vil jeg kun se om den går der hvor jeg går i biografen, og ikke i den anden ende af landet (ret svært at få et hurtigt overblik over babybio film i København)
3747	5	a	this is the best police parking game I've ever played I mean the controls are easy like so easy that a baby can do it I don't know if they could play the game but the controls are so easy that the baby can do it but it's not easy for a baby because it's challenging it's not all that easy they're going to give you the challenges and turns and the timing is great that turning is like better than a car I mean this is such a great game thank you guys for creating this game also I want to be a police officer.
3748	4	a	Needs some changes to it but over all its good!!
3749	5	a	I like because is install is comform in the summarry
3750	3	a	The need to use token otp defeats the purpose of mobile app. I can't do \nsimple transaction on the move without token. Can't they recognise the \nphone number or do sms otp.
3751	5	a	I think its the best game in the world but it takes you ages to unlock a new abilaty and it takes you eeven longer to have a family. When you had a mate you have sex and I sleep with her and I steel don't get a baby t rex.
3752	5	a	Excellent App using for Work related Shifts
3753	2	a	When I connect my sbh50 to phone either by BT or NFC the application smart connect not start and the smart xtras dnot working any more is there a solution I'm really disappointed from Sony
3754	1	a	How do you but it as your keybord????
3755	5	a	I love it so bad
3756	1	a	Resi g pernah terbaca.  Sangat disayangkan.pop up iklannya annoying sekali. Masih bagusan yg versi desktopnya.
3757	1	a	Програма розрядила мені мобільний, GSam Battery Monitor дав таку інформацію: Usage Details - Magnetic Field: 2d 10h пристрій: Google Nexus S, Android 4.1.1
3758	5	a	Works great on my MyTouch4G!! Love it!
3759	5	a	My kids love this apps so much.
3760	5	a	i love it i wish they have all of these things and news from this app in Google . #superfun
3761	4	a	Sadly there is no way to filter or block specific users. I played against someone called kidchess919 twice now and each time he messages me with vile disgusting abuse and harassment in the chat. There is no way to report it either it seems . I'm hesitant to start new games because I may be forced to play against him again
3762	1	a	Don't waste your time on down loading..
3763	1	a	I do not get it Dumb and pointless I clicked on and it still didn't work Waste of space. Motorola Droid
3764	5	a	Love this drum machine. It has helped me write some bits here and there on the go! Easy user interface, and plenty of sample slots. A few minor tweaks to the UI (time signatures, and sequencer) and it will be the absolute best drum machine on a mobile device! Keep up the great work!
3765	1	a	Tiny cards, bad layout and ads in-between every game.  I do not want to see another commercial for that stupid war game.  Not worth it.
3766	5	a	I just want to say that I love this game, just the difficulty of it makes it even better. I don't understand why people freak out about the difficulty of it. It's really fun!!!
3767	4	a	Please put a Morse code recognition function also from receiving camera light ( you can do it by simply on intensity variation software program code)
3768	5	a	Love this app  !
3769	3	a	I wld give it 5stars except fr the fact tat my boutique gets out of sync wit t server al t tym so t dresses I ordered are not shwin in the catalogue n even now I hanged two dresses on the racks n my boutique got refreshed aftr which I cannot find those dresses... Its really irritating
3770	3	a	На сайті у вас є українська версія, а тут немає вибору.
3771	5	a	Mine got four point multi touch unexpected!!! Thanks for the app creator
3772	1	a	There is no feature option to copy and paste the words... Need more thai words especially the dating section, pls add more updates and fix this... It is a waste buying this app, would like a refund back if no changes are done..
3773	5	a	I like these game so much but it's so hard
3774	5	a	He's a cute little bunny and I love this game u should install it
3775	1	a	Paid for ad free and to unlock animals, charged my account but didn't unlock ANYTHING. Un installed and installed again, still nothing. Please fix or give me my money back!!
3776	1	a	Too many glitches and freezes.
3777	1	a	Paid for a game that crashes right after the G5 logo. They said they fixed the crash but that's a lie. Wish I could get a refund or fix the issue. Disappointed!
3778	1	a	This app had no right to read device and app history. It is violating everyone's phone privacy.
3779	1	a	This not that good. Sorry. Its playing like a toy. Strongly not recommended
3780	3	a	Just started playing. The graphics are dull. Improve it then give 4 stars. Have 2 play more then will revisit! :)
3781	2	a	Its boring because you have to do the same cupcakes over and over
3782	1	a	Pikpok, freaking fix this game please for the new Android update, it doesn't work anymore.
3783	1	a	My phone will not connect to the game. When I go to sign in the app crashes. I have a Sony Xperia X Performance. A phone that can freaking remote play any game on my PS4 without a single problem. There has never once been a connection issue while connecting with ANYTHING. Especially since my phone is the top of the line for sony phones. Like what the hell.
3784	1	a	It's really bad and adverts allways come up
3785	1	a	Doesn't work, using Galaxy S3, can't detect music player. Can't detect default, or Rocket Music Player, as its not on the list.
3786	5	a	the 3d looks very neat and the animals very well modeled. you can walk into the forest and test our skills at aim your target. cool game
3787	1	a	Bad graphics and control .
3788	5	a	Seems easy at first but provides a great challenge and fun gameplay.
3789	2	a	Awful amount of ads distracting and annoying, deleting
3790	3	a	Not truly random? Great app and I love the simplicity, but I'm not sure it's truly random.   I would use this mostly for Heroclix which uses D6. I did four rounds of 100 rolls each, and it seems weighted towards the six over the one. Every round of rolls, the six came out noticeably ahead. By the end of four hundred rolls, the spread was 1(53), 2(62), 3(78), 4(73), 5(57), 6(77).  Perhaps this will eventually even out over thousands of rolls, but I'm not sure I can sell it to my usual crew of players in good conscience. (Though I suppose if everyone is using the app, everyone benefits from apparent weight).
3791	3	a	but needs to be bigger
3792	5	a	Does what it says. Hope the numbers keep climbing.
3793	5	a	Makes everything pretty easy to use 👍👏
3794	5	a	Darood taj b upload karen lazmi
3795	5	a	Самый красивый лабиринт из всех что я видел
3796	1	a	It doesn't have any save/export option, so don't waste your time with it.
3797	5	a	So far so good. Just hate the force closes
3798	5	a	그랱 앞 윤랑 하하 !!!
3799	4	a	I would tell for improvement  like give words for children so that ,they can understand easily .
3800	2	a	This is NOTHING like a wild dog the dog runs so slow and its nothing like living in the wild! Don't get this game unless you wanna waste your time!!
3801	4	a	Its working good on me it rspond what i say 4 stars
3802	5	a	I had been using root explorer for 4 years. until I had to extract an apk from a gz on my phone because I was too lazy to get to the computer. I installed rar, but then I had 2 apps to do 1 thing. fast, intuitive, works. a bit of a hassle with reopening my bookmarks, but pretty good already. rooted s4 mini 4.4.2 stock.
3803	5	a	It awesome but its hard to control the dragon plz let us control it OK thx but awesome game!!!:-D
3804	5	a	Brings back good memories of the games of yore.
3805	5	a	Super app  I like it
3806	1	a	It's not fun you can't do any tricks because you break everything and so much lagg
3807	4	a	I use this app on my tablet to personalize (in case someone finds it), label the screens and provide inspiration to my students with quotes. It's a fun program. Was looking for something like this!
3808	5	a	Great Sound quality and clarity.tks alot for developing devotional apps! Lord Murugan bless everyone!
3809	5	a	Would be great if the widget links to your own PSNprofiles trophy list. 5 stars *****
3810	1	a	What's the point of putting an ad on the screen?! That defeats the whole purpose of this app
3811	1	a	No documentation \u003d 0/5 stars.
3812	5	a	I love it i use it all the time 5 star rating for this one
3813	4	a	I mostly play forty thieves.  Back button freezes sometimes.  Other than that, it works as advertised.
3814	3	a	This app was once the best out there now when you attempt to join a server it becomes unresponsive and it is just unusable.
3815	1	a	Used to work, but stopped working on latest update.
3816	5	a	Good app  😀Ja maa durga 😀
3817	1	a	Horrible. I just got this game and I am disappointed
3818	2	a	Hare krishna!! 2 ol..gud bt v cant able 2 download pics!!  :|
3819	1	a	Worst app I've seen in a long time.
3820	5	a	I think you should add more advanced things and also a money maker. It's a strange concept, you see make it inside your house and every time you kill a person it gives you gralats make it where it's cheap you can buy as much as you like and where you can upgrade them.
3821	5	a	Anything for my brothers across the border. I am a Indian \u0026 I love my nation like pakistanis love theres. We must love and respect each other.
3822	4	a	Every upgrade 2 a new phone I download Big Win
3823	4	a	kok RRI Batam dan Tanjung Pinang belum ada ya di applikasi ini?
3824	5	a	I LOVE IT SO MUCH
3825	1	a	I really wanted to talk to my friend but everytime I go on it all I see is a black screen! Fix it and I'll rate five stars.
3826	3	a	About brave2 it more fun
3827	5	a	It is an intresting game for tourits
3828	5	a	Glad I found this app. Works great.
3829	1	a	Hay un error cuando llego al nivel 30, solucionen eso, siempre quiero terminar esa dificultad y no puedo por ese bug
3830	4	a	"Great app and simple for a 83 year old like me to use.  A few bugs   1) On the task-bar when trying to edit apps on home screen if clicked comes up with \Can't run application\"" have to go into Big Launcher Preferences to edit home screen apps  2) Have Whatsapp installed and if you have a contact who also has whatsapp their number is displayed twice"""
3831	4	a	"Great to play. It took me a little bit to figure out what the colors of the squares mean during play. Got it now. Only thing I would change would be bolder lines around the 9x9 squares and to make the background more transparent on the themes. Many others have said the same things. Also, a little tutorial to explain what the box with 1-9 means (it puts a small number in the box to help visualize what that move will do) and explain what the \c\"" in calligraphy is for...I haven't figured that out yet. Fun!"""
3832	5	a	I seen lots of lwp but this is the best and I just have the free version. I recommended to all to nit the full version I know I am.  Love it like it love it surpernova
3833	5	a	Joyce.WHAT A BLESSING THIS APP. WORKS GREAT AND WEL DONE! THIS IS WHAT A GOOD APP LOOKS LIKE. GOD BLESS THE PERSON WHO START IT! GRACIAs
3834	2	a	I had Turbo Dismount and then I decided to get this game. The problem is that it is very boring. There isn't much customization so it repeats the same thing over and over. It isn't funny like Turbo Dismount because the rag doll just slowly crawls down the stairs. Overall the game needs a little bit of a rework and needs more polishing up. If you, the reader, would like a game like this, get Turbo Dismount for a better overall experience. If some one read this, thank you for taking you time to.
3835	5	a	it does its job and, unlike many others, it's less than 2 MB!  the only additional feature I would like is a switch metal to nylon sound.
3836	1	a	The game itself is fine, but not only do you have to purchase the full game and only have a few levels to play, but there is also a ton of ads in the game. Just about after ever innings there is like a 30 second ad. It's frustrating as hell.
3837	4	a	Yak. ..what a waste of time game . The most idiot game I have played
3838	5	a	Thanks! This helps alot of people especially seafarers and cadets
3839	5	a	I'm 8 but I looking fie
3840	1	a	After one month one has to pay
3841	4	a	5 start for apps and -1 for forecast. Decided to uninstall. Sorry.
3842	5	a	really good on my Galaxy S3 i just wish it could be in a keyboard..
3843	5	a	I love it but a lot of ads
3844	4	a	1 thing when cars change lane the indicater comes 0.2seconds before you turn AAAAGGGGGHHHHHH
3845	2	a	The graphics and the controls are awful.
3846	5	a	I love it even when I can't solve the first one :-D
3847	1	a	Does not find any restaurant in the city I choose and gives a error message. Fix it
3848	1	a	Crashes every time you save the picture.
3849	4	a	Really should have better preloaded lists based on known habitats.   Overall it appears to be a good looking app with nice potential but the animal/bird lists are sparse and the plant lists nonexistent.   worth downloading just for future potential.
3850	4	a	Berguna banget, sayangnya kata-katanya kurang banyak...
3851	5	a	Small app that just works and does not looks for a whole range of permissions in order to send you advertising. So far I've seen none unlike some of the other volume control apps I've downloaded and then uninstalled. I did not need the paid version, but if you do this is the one to have. A simple yet effective app.
3852	5	a	It is the best game ever I played You should also play it once , 💝💝💝💝😒
3853	1	a	I've tried to download it, but it doesn't freaking work. It just brings me back to the play store, saying that it's downloaded when its no where to be found!!!
3854	3	a	Need to add grenades explode in hand,and so where u can actually pull the grenade pin out
3855	5	a	Love it.  Hope it improves my brain
3856	5	a	بارك الله للقائمين على هذا التطبيق وجزاهم عنا خير الجزاء وجعله الله فى \nميزان حسناتهم
3857	4	a	Could you add a free mode? Otherwise it's a good game
3858	1	a	I dont wanna be mean but i dont like waisting money i cant believe this plus i have 0.11.0 so...............
3859	5	a	Well this game is a total kick as s with BRUCE LEE im a big fan of him and his great kung fu moves and his really great speeches yea I mean the game is good not only good but great its like mortal kombat x on the phone but a little less and more at the same time tell totally this game is gooooood really goood
3860	3	a	I can't find the download for my gear 2 watch anywhere! I looked in the galaxy apps on my galaxy note 5. And also the gear apps. Any idea where the Samsung download is?
3861	1	a	On the second level, I saved partway into the mission and did some human stuff. When I reloaded, I could not issue any commands. A mobile game should allow you to save and reload without bugging out and being unplayable. I want to like this game, but if I can't play it, I can't like it.
3862	2	a	Only lasted a day on my phone before it turned into spinning blocks.
3863	5	a	It's fun and I play it when I'm on the train to work
3864	1	a	OMG this sucks... Play Hay Day
3865	3	a	First, Players should absolutely not be able to play a 2 or joker as the first card in a trick. Secondly, If all the cards of the same number are played consecutively, any player should be able to complete the set regardless of being skipped. Same applies to doubles and triples. Anyone can complete the set if they are quick enough. Finally, only one two is necessary to clear the board at any time.
3866	5	a	I think for the first major distraction in a city hull Miami beach can give me the right time to visiting a reminder, but is not limited to Costs Rich need a real QUEEN if others is give it's possible to another burn that way, or in a busy way let it happen at the real.
3867	4	a	It is a workout for your brain.
3868	4	a	This is a free app, which is great. It's easy to use and I appreciate the different levels of expertise tested. However, there are so many advertisements that it becomes frustrating.
3869	5	a	I like the game a lot. I'm a dart player and this is the first game to bring my competitive side out. Only thing I wish it had cricket as well
3870	1	a	Cant find it on my phone
3871	5	a	Controls need work but the play is great. Thanks.
3872	5	a	The best launcher ever made. So sad when they stopped developing it. Then today I find the developer has a new version availabke, but we must pay again to register it? Pay twice for one app? As much as I love the app, I won't pay again for it when I already bought precious version.
3873	1	a	it's not a good translator
3874	4	a	Al dia con todo: musica deporte y politica
3875	5	a	it very fast,good quality.response good .
3876	4	a	Had been using this app for a year. Love everything about the app, easy to use, inserting lines.. only thing is I can't view nor edit file from my phone. No multi device sharing function.
3877	4	a	Actual Gantt feature works great, only complaints are no portrait mode, always forces to landscape. Also, I'm totally for other languages, but if 98% (guess) of your users will commonly understand English, there'll be better success if you use that for your example template and app photos.
3878	1	a	"Video not working and u people simply says \cannot play\"" this is not fare waisted my time"""
3879	5	a	Naresh kumar love the game for my om loard karlo
3880	5	a	Butterflies and fireflies in a forest setting
3881	4	a	Does the job. Interface is not the most attractive.  Definitely needs an import button, in case a person needs to factory reset or has a problem with the phone.
3882	2	a	Really fun and addictive game but crashes/force closes before, during and after game. Please fix Mr/Ma'am Gamer...it is a shame really as could get higher rating because it is a great game...will re-install when fixed🔚😩
3883	4	a	This is among my favorite metronome apps that I've tried over the years, but it stops when my screen turns off. I would love to be able to practice without having to keep my screen on for extended periods of time.
3884	5	a	Realy exciting game. Looking fowrd for some more such good ventures.
3885	2	a	Parth(my son)loves to play mobile games so with krishna some fun .its just to keep the character with some real virtues  he will become like krishna if some virtue of krishna he will understand .so let him enjoy
3886	5	a	It is absolutely useful for students. Jameel ahmed
3887	1	a	It's to bland not that many options in my opinion
3888	4	a	Great game, can be better though
3889	5	a	Its really a great help for our daily needs.. please improve it while going back to the main page, it doesnt take us to the same place so we have to search ourself.
3890	3	a	Good only but not..... So nice...
3891	1	a	This not a good app because its only for the hindi reading persnos
3892	5	a	Comcast xfinilywifinetwork Comcast cable television series services finicky Comcast sigin information CONNECT gmail account elviraramos201507@gmail com Setup Samsung account
3893	2	a	Bilkul Bakwas pekg's he sab se acha pekg srif ufone me he
3894	3	a	I bought the full version when I had an iPhone worked great.  I've now got a s5 and downloaded the free version it won't let me log in. Am i going to get robbed? Do I have to buy it again?
3895	5	a	Why leader boards are not updating . It's only showing my 1st performance . Other things are cool . Keep it up
3896	5	a	Love this app. When u shopping I can look thi GPS up to see what stores are offering
3897	1	a	I gotta ask, whats this really supposed to do? All I can get is the oscilloscope and some funky static noises, No sound around me is being recorded, amplified, etc its just random 'junk' noise.    Is this just a empty shell to pack some ads and ship them out?
3898	4	a	My 4yo is car mad. He even wants to change his name to Jeremy Clarkson he loves this game
3899	2	a	How to use this app??what the root??how to connect it..
3900	1	a	Well that's a new freakin record only have that game 5 seconds my mediately delete it so stupid
3901	1	a	Very very worst game they are not showing any sign to decorate the front \nyard please don't install this game
3902	5	a	Wish we could have some unlimited days. I have playing this game from its inception
3903	1	a	I've wasted my time trying to connect it virtually in EVERY possible way, but it doesn't work at all. Absolutely disappointed
3904	1	a	Lvl 252 si 325 coincid. Unul din ele trebuie sters.
3905	3	a	This app is just a normal flashlight nothing different
3906	1	a	Used to work on previous phone. Now i can only see a black screen upon opening the app on my samsung galaxy s8. What a disappointment. If there is a fix/update, will change to 5 stars!
3907	1	a	I cant even open it before it crashes, but if I want to listen I havve to have the Crashed sign across the screen!! disappointing
3908	2	a	Doesn't autorotate and game is ridiculously tiny in landscape mode. Too bad.
3909	1	a	Infested with advertising. Game is so boring and simple. Not challengin9g enough, even for a 3 year old. No innovation , Horribe graphics. Is this the best you can come up with? Its terrible. Get some new creative developers or just give up coming out with this rubbish. A cheap imitation of Temple run - the same concept ! F***ingFrauds!
3910	5	a	I've been using this theme for months now, \u0026 apologize for just now getting around to giving the dev the 5 stars deserved - wish I could give it 10!  It makes all the other themes (even paid ones!) look boring and cheap. Now, make me an ADW Launcher steampunk theme. I'll even pay for that one!! ZTE Warp (Gingerbread)
3911	3	a	The questions are so common. You should add new variety of questions
3912	5	a	I like it totototototo much
3913	5	a	one of the only white noise apps that work with my tinnitus
3914	1	a	Very bad very bad game
3915	5	a	I love it ,may the Lord reward you for your hard work. ....
3916	1	a	More ads than content and now it force closes over and over in a loop. All energy diverted to ads, none used for development. FOH
3917	5	a	Mnogo nivoa, fenomenalna HD grafika, mod za dva igraca...
3918	5	a	Works perfectly for what it does. And super small file size is a bonus.
3919	5	a	thanka for implementing the inr en option. awesome app
3920	1	a	fine but you have to make it more efficient, it takes to much space
3921	3	a	Game of my childhood! :-) but very bad controls and only 3 lifes.instead to shoot he jump sometimes
3922	1	a	Had to delete the app as it won't stop opening everytime I open any other app on my phone. Not sure what you did in the last update as it was fine before that.
3923	1	a	This app has been generating over 2-4gb of background data each month and I haven't actually used the app for months! :-/
3924	3	a	If the joystick had better feedback and you could set the sensetivity, this would be a 5 star game. But as of now my thumb slips off the joystick because im trying to get the fish to respond to my input but it just sorta....bloops that way. Yeah man.
3925	5	a	Actually at first I thought it was simple as the name suggest but I have a fantastic experience after using it ...so adorable bunny which wake up you !! and the nice way to begin ur day..😗
3926	5	a	I'm a tech-head.  I would suffocate without this app. Many thanks.
3927	5	a	Well for anime lover like me its a great app bt that doesn't mean u must be one like me to use this app :D jst try it its gud deserves 5* star
3928	5	a	I have toyed with cameras, old smart phones and countless other apps trying to find some sort of wifi remote surveillance system thats practical, cheap and WORKS. Rearview has exceeded my expectations in every way. Thank you developers!
3929	5	a	I'll be appearing AIIMS next year and this app is very useful to me..
3930	5	a	World best app I always give 5 start on this app
3931	5	a	Used this for awhile, really dig it.   Any plans for Port-Forwarding?
3932	5	a	Too bad it dried my battery too fast for my device. Still, it's really cool
3933	5	a	Can you don't make MB .
3934	1	a	terrible UI in design and functionality. No Dropbox support.
3935	1	a	It's not app it's ad in which they fit app
3936	2	a	Not one succesfuld bow upgrade
3937	5	a	works great on the i9300 running Resurrection remix lp  ROM and being able to submit your own designs and have them in the download category is awesome 👍
3938	1	a	Installed it just minutesafter first use. Not worth sh**
3939	2	a	Good app, I love it, so much, but I think I 'installed a pig in a poke'! Didn't know I can't customise nothing until I get the REAL THING! Too bad.
3940	5	a	Perfect for my Bluetooth its exactly what I was looking for
3941	1	a	I am not able to sign in. I tried to sign in with gmail and Facebook both \nbut i got failed to sign in. Please resolve this issue. It is not signing \nup and without signing up i can't play test series
3942	5	a	Whoever doesn't like it well they're missing out
3943	5	a	This is one of the best live wallpapers ive seen so pretty and lots of options for customization!  Best free app  for nature lovers!
3944	5	a	tapi mohon perbaiki lagi download nya... setiap mau dengar ceramahnya harus didownload ulang?? masih ada ceramah yang tidak mau didownload... setiap mau dihidupkan harus download ulang ceramah tersebut berulang kali... thanks.... Wassalam...
3945	4	a	Its a nice and simple fun game. Keeps me thinking. Only down point is i wish theyd give you more moves in certain levels. But altogether a good game
3946	4	a	Amazing,it appears like phone has some thing wrong...
3947	3	a	This sucks cause you can only play 3 different levels then you need pay to unlock the rest of the game. Big let down cause I Played this on computer and am able to play on my phone or tablet. I like it a lot.
3948	5	a	It was relly cool and I personally think it was awesome
3949	5	a	" with great features \nand works beautifully without being overly complicated. 100% free. Thank \nyou to the developers. :)"""
3950	4	a	If you have had at least a year of French, this app will help you review what you know.
3951	5	a	Exceptionally good app for all Madrid busses!
3952	5	a	Response is very good with this app, my locality neat and clean. It happens after posting Complient, with in two days they responded very quickly.
3953	3	a	I love the game. I've beaten it over 5 times iver the years......my issue is......it won't let me go onto online mode. I love the online boss battles with others! And the fact that that's the only at to earn the bought currency. Fix please!!
3954	4	a	I would like connect Google calendar with my schedule
3955	5	a	I am playing this game it's..awesome ,so many games I had played but not such as like this .I will soon buy full version of this game as soon as I can.
3956	2	a	Unfortunately that's about it. I played another game over a year ago, pretty much the same thing except they gave you five or six actual levels for Fred, and not just a brief tutorial. The game is nicely put together but buying it would be 20 more levels that are virtually identical, just a different layout.  There really isn't any strategy to be had that isn't obvious. Perhaps good for small children.
3957	4	a	On the game one time I've fought a whole wolf pack
3958	1	a	No new offers i wasted time for downloading this app
3959	5	a	Love this game in Arcade Mode- 150 levels with variety of games.
3960	4	a	This appl is complete because you can do all you need to do with it!
3961	5	a	Does exactly what it says. No sneaky permissions. Would pay for this. Thanks dev.
3962	5	a	Wonderful , fabulous, best , fantastic game all the words are fail towards this game
3963	5	a	Traditioal game and funny sounds
3964	5	a	Its from my fav game creator! Lf2 was the first game i played back in 2004, even tho i still play it today and it is even awesome with mods! Brought old memories back! This port of pc hf is so good, only problem is big controller size on the screen!!! Update- Thank you so much for reply marti! I still remember you and your partner name which came after we defeat lf2! God...i have one suggestion...please add online!  like wifi LAN and IP address one. It would be more awesome!
3965	1	a	Does not work can not bring up my reservation. Buttons don't work
3966	1	a	They just ask you to download a lot of other things! Then won't even work. I'd give it zero stars if I could.
3967	3	a	It wont let me freeze stuff it will do a FATAL ERROR ##########################################
3968	3	a	Words like ill and Quinn didn't even work
3969	5	a	Not bad for a chat app...could be a little more refined as to nearby users and not thousands of miles away!
3970	1	a	No reason this app needs access to make phone calls or have access to my photos
3971	2	a	How to login ,reply me fast
3972	4	a	Could not finish because green bar was blocking some mice in chapter 19...dont put stuff under green bar.
3973	1	a	Nothing epic, would get a higher rating if it actaully gave out coins the 2nd day like its suppose too.
3974	5	a	Keep up creating a great property management inspection app. You have the opportunity to outshine major PM software companies that lack this type of app.
3975	3	a	Sae pisan...mung panginten pengembangan nu salajengna supados merhatoskeun kasar sareng lemesna basa..tambihan deui kosakata na..hurip..sunda
3976	5	a	Very useful app, one of a few I use very frequently, and never any problems, it does what you ask immediately...nothing more, nothing less. Wish more were the same.
3977	3	a	As above, except for the slow moving clouds, nothing much is moving. Could have the cows feeding \u0026 going or coming out of the shed, etc
3978	5	a	This app is fab. For beginers...but its a copy paste of book
3979	4	a	Been looking for a classic style Warcraft type game for months and this is the best one. Hope you make a 2nd version with larger maps and more variety in warriors and fortresses. Needs a deselect player button and more crafting for buildings and farms for characters to further the depth if the game.
3980	1	a	One of worst app.never try to install it
3981	2	a	All you do in triple a is lose and it gets really hard by taking away the spinning thing at the bottom of the screen. And they make the strike zone.
3982	5	a	اتمني اضافه خاصيه القراة الليليه
3983	2	a	The app is just clunky and constantly reminding you that you are on a trial.. It's a little upsetting.
3984	2	a	These app is getting crashed in my Nokia 7 plus running on Android pie 9.0 Please do something
3985	3	a	Using Nexus 4. Used to work fairly well, now automatically shuts off after 15 minutes!   Playback a bit rubbish  - once it plays can't pause /rewind.
3986	3	a	Mission one wasn't too bad. Little hard though to get the number combos for computer and door. I got it though!!!. Starting mission 2.
3987	4	a	Good game but I'm not sure I trust it now as I just lost on an answer that \nwas wrong. Definitely wrong. I even checked afterwards in case it was my \nimagination but no, I had definitely put my million on the right answer. \nThis is a basic question and answer game , if it can't get the answer right \nthen not much point is there?
3988	5	a	I love the gently floating bubbles of pure color! This is my only background because I love it so much.
3989	5	a	There is absolutely no reason to give this anything other than 5 stars, if you don't want a black background then don't install it you wingnuts
3990	5	a	Its good to kill sometime
3991	5	a	I love this app. There's so many different styles and sizes to choose from. And you narrow your search which doesn't seem to work all that great but love it anyway.
3992	5	a	Khoop sunder app aahey. Dev aaplyala sukhi thewo.
3993	2	a	How can I rate this app.....before I've  even  completed my  1st search?? 😠   After I've  typed in the city and state..... it's  saying  ✴ City  and  state  not found ✴  HELLO!!   I DO BELIEVE  THAT  I  KNOW  WHERE I LIVE !!!  Can  I  get  an Amen ??
3994	3	a	Horrible dialogue and story, some nice secrets, very challenging at first but becomes too easy with proper weapon, no last boss fight, you kill trash and walk through a portal and it ends. Still had fun though
3995	2	a	Was loving it when playing without logging in. Then remembered I used to \nhave an account when playing through FB on my PC. Logged in and now the \ngame is almost at a standstill. Eventually it freezes and also freezes my \ntablet and have to do a force restart. Will be uninstalling Hidden Express \nif this isn't sorted. Tablet is new and plenty of memory. Shame as it's a \ngood game.
3996	1	a	Truly this is the worst android app that I have ever seen. It does nothing that you would expect it to do. Update:  installed BubbleUPnP and it just works flawlessly. Sony should go hire those developers...NO WAIT! Don't do that!!
3997	4	a	on level 64 so you know I love the game but we need more stuff to gift people. If not more new different stuff. just change it up a little. also it does not let me see my likes until I give to everybody and a lot of the times you can t see the clothes or anything in the store. if people can't see it how are they going to like it. Fix these little issues and I'll give you five stars
3998	2	a	I have experienced constant app crashes from the ad system and have been unable to retrieve my save data after attempting to reinstall the game
3999	5	a	I run my own consulting company and this app has been great for letting me track how I spend my time. I love that you can do automated daily backups. I back up to Dropbox so I never worry about losing data.
4000	5	a	I like this app too much continue and add update daily
4001	2	a	I'd rate it better as I see the potential value but anytime I try to access parts of the program the app crashes unexpectedly.... Fix your bugs and we'll rate you better...
4002	1	a	اذا بتشيلو الاعلانات بتصير فيف ستار
4003	1	a	Very inaccurate. When I first download the app I turned it on and didn't move and it said I went 300metres.
4004	5	a	Amazing...reminded my school days !!
4005	1	a	I mean come on a floating gun
4006	4	a	micro transactions are always annoying but a fun game to pass the time
4007	4	a	Easy to pick up and play. Way too easy?
4008	5	a	"i Love it , so cute .. :\)"""
4009	1	a	It just said turned on and turned off it didn't actually do anything please update  your app! It's been 3 years!!!!
4010	4	a	Love the 3 closed spade
4011	1	a	Please stop free apps I would rather pay then be harassed by advertising...
4012	2	a	It's battery heavy application. When I open battery settings it always says 38% for Tray volume. Even display doesn't need that much battery.
4013	2	a	Isn't like the old version. Don't get the same perks... Really disappointed
4014	5	a	Nice helicopter GAME! Very entertaining!
4015	4	a	Very good app. More housing information could be added though
4016	4	a	Vigorous Eyes follows to keep your health be a fit.
4017	3	a	pretty nice ssh server. the biggesy problem i found is that it does not create directories when copying recursively.
4018	5	a	Semoga aja app ini ada updatenya biar fitur2 nya ada yang baru
4019	4	a	looking fwd to zday evolution(s); IE An 'accomplished-tasks' zenday section, which graphically didn't clutter the actual calendar wd be nice n free flowin!
4020	3	a	The game often freezes and won't let me match tiles. I love the game but the freezing is frustrating. Tried uninstalling and redownloading....will see how that works.
4021	4	a	That would be cool if it did
4022	1	a	To many advertisements.  In game ads slow my frame rate, it is very annoying. I finished season one, but I am considering uninstalling. The game itself is fun and addicting, its jut not worth dealing with all the ads. 2 stars.....Edit. 1 star uninstalled frame hit makes it unplayable without killing data and wifi. Dont download this pos game
4023	3	a	This app is good, especially for playing with chord progressions, however piano mode is useless. You need to make a way to edit the notes recorded.
4024	5	a	My virus guard detected the testing virus,thanks for this.
4025	2	a	The greetings in this app are so lame, morbid, or insulting that I couldn't find a single one to suit the occasion. Nice concept otherwise.
4026	3	a	This is a good aap but not my favorite I like this app but thoda thoda
4027	5	a	Very simple ... loving it.
4028	1	a	It was the worst app ever I couldn't even get in with my own fingerprint
4029	5	a	good game love the concept
4030	5	a	Helpful! Much more convenient than paper and pencil! Also, the app applies the rules rather than having to figure it all out myself.
4031	5	a	Best  garden's I've ever seen !!!
4032	1	a	It is so hard at season 3 two rooms of pain
4033	2	a	It's been going out on me at least 6 times in the last hour and I'm very upset I never had a problem with this app before my Internet is on point so it's not that don't know what going on but please fix it or I'm going to have to un install it !!
4034	5	a	I gave this app previously 4 stars because i couldn't save directly on the microSD card and i requested this option. Now they made it happen, they listened! This is the best file transfer app over wifi and i love it! Now i give it 5 stars! Thanks
4035	5	a	Wonderful app that is quite fun to play.  My only complaint about the app itself is that one of the redeal conditionsisn't included.  I have had 2 games where an entire suit of cards is dealt to the table. This should cause a redeal but it does not.  Now i just wish more people were playing online.
4036	1	a	Even with the new update, the widget does not work or display properly after opened. When opened, the bottom row looks weird and won't work.   Verizon - HTC Droid DNA
4037	5	a	Works great on my Samsung Galaxy Phone. Nice and simple App. - Thanks
4038	1	a	Worst services ever I created an account on it and backed up my massages and contact details, now I logged in again now it is showing not such exist What the hell is this and there is no feature of regain your account
4039	1	a	No bonus games - just a money amt. U could put it on auto spin and let it go but what fun is that? Small log in amt. Does have several different slots but UNINSTALL today. Stick w/ my slots bonanza thank u...
4040	4	a	" meant that progression through the game happened through random clicking rather than any logical deduction."""
4041	5	a	I used to play it in my computer. My computer got spilt. I couldn't play this game. My friend told me that there's a app called secret builders. I was sooo damn happy
4042	1	a	Ne postoji opcija ukucavanja broja autobusa koji vam je potreban sa \npregledom naziva i brojeva svih stanica. Uz svu moju volju da je koristim, \nkrajnje neprakticna app.
4043	5	a	Ma sha allah it's very good app. But the only problem here is it can't played when offline 😞
4044	1	a	The ice pops are so boring to make and you have to buy buy the rest of the things it is not fair and also the smurfette figure that vanity wants is locked and you have to make a princess cake to unlock it this game sucks
4045	5	a	That a phone would leave this out if you're phone did this is the one small app
4046	5	a	It‘s agood app  :D Ilove it
4047	5	a	can't express enough - this dialer is excellent, ability to set / arrange tabs for favorites, dialer, contacts etc... always wanted that for android... perfect... themes are great too. worth every penny on sale or off...
4048	5	a	Had to do over to get more points love the graphics. Need to loosen up the wins tho. 4 hrs for more points is too long. But will give it 5 stars for now.
4049	1	a	Terrible. Worst game I have ever played......:[
4050	3	a	I have a note edge. We use this for work, paid account however I don't have access to all features. App opens on main page and I don't have access to any others, can't even change my status. Needs updates to keep up with technology asap.
4051	3	a	Emulator runs rom wonderfully. The controls could be tweaked a little a better analog stick for the ps1. It moves the characters at a walking speed. I can't find any settings for sensitivity of the joystick. The joystick is essentially the same as the pad just round. If update joystick(or reply and tell me how to make the joystick work dual speed like a normal controller exe. Pushing up a Lil on joystick walk past up a lot run) I'd gladly give five stars. It did work well enough for me to purchase the full version however I'd still like the joystick fixed.
4052	5	a	This is part of my trio of 'must have' security apps. The devs are responsive to issues and there is a lot of functionality to keep personal apps (Drive, email, etc) safe and private. The added layer of security is fairly unobtrusive and genuinely useful.
4053	3	a	I've played the game on PC and I find that it is numerous amounts easier to play; Not because I stink at it on a touchscreen device, but because the moves/tricks on touch screen devices are so similar in how you do them that when simply using the bat to hit coconuts the game thinks I'm trying to perform a wheelie or some other tricks, resulting in my death. Its annoying because I then have to be extra careful and lose points in the process. Frustrating in that aspect, but otherwise fun.
4054	4	a	Intense and smooth action, just what I was looking for. Thanks....
4055	4	a	Ako je Arena Sport ubacena, onda ja ne vidim dobro !! .. I aplikacija nece da ucita komentare.
4056	3	a	Muito bom , mas acho que deveria ter mais receitas, com vídeos....
4057	5	a	Perfect companion for Llama. If you run into a shared library file error during install, please don't blame the DEV just download and flash the gapps version that's specifically for your ROM. The Llama Map addon depends on a couple of core Google files for it to run. Google Maps may be working properly even though these files are missing.
4058	1	a	It just tells you how to screen shot on different phones doesn't actually does screen shot you can google what buttons to press instead of wasting memory and giving them a download! And most of these so terrific reviews are them btw doing reviews on there own app smh uninstall asap. Your welcome for the download
4059	1	a	I can not play! It will not start. What is up with that? Please fix it I want to plat it so bad!:(:(:(
4060	3	a	The fact that you can be at the end and die and then have to restart is stupid. Maybe make a half way point.
4061	1	a	Useless . can't generate videos.
4062	5	a	Fun playing with my brother
4063	5	a	Its a great game I'm glad I played this demo. The full game is definitely worth every cent.
4064	5	a	Every Event Planner should have this app! It makes my life so easy. I can't believe how easy it was to use. I was able to check in over 200 guest without any problems. It is user friendly and I will definitely be using it at my next event.
4065	5	a	Needs a course for everyone to brag about score. Also kinda hard to change the disc flight from Hyzer and Annie.
4066	5	a	Love the colour scheme, thought that stripe of colour in the notification share looks a little off, maybe if it was centred under the profile pic?
4067	5	a	Downloaded this app and booked my theory test for the next week and passed 1st time. Highly recommend as I did see the same questions as in the app.
4068	1	a	Don't play this stupid game only if you like waisting your time
4069	2	a	I downloaded the suggested app to get bubbles  but no bubbles ? Help please!
4070	3	a	Swak. Punte werk nie meer nie.(soos alles anders vanaf die kampusse saamgesmelt het).
4071	4	a	Its good but kinda laged
4072	5	a	FREE!? This makes android... CYBORG. All of those stock Widgets that used to make me want to rip my hair out are useful now. You don't have to stop anything to find out the time day date, or shuffle through your recents to play the song gameloft stopped. Your applications are always at the ready, you can switch to Skype and then spam back,or pop out the window browser mid game without having to have it tabbed before you play. I LOVE THIS. I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO FISH FOR THE VOICE TRANSLATOR. yeah, it's a must
4073	1	a	Mobilwebben fungerar bättre i Chrome, appen måste tillföra något annars fyller den ingen funktion.
4074	3	a	Looks great but clouds haven't updated in 12 hours and can't access \nsettings at the bottom using 18:9 screen. Hopefully that will be fixed
4075	3	a	Unregistered cam access using these app.i dnt hav registered in any VPN account so is there any way for ppl like me
4076	1	a	This widget still opens the app... I miss the old widget for the previous version. Don't like having to download each feature when all I ever used was the flashlight to begin with. I understand the writers explanation, but those with the old app shouldn't have been forced to update.
4077	3	a	"Used to love it, was an easy to use reliable app until recently... It has \nstarted giving a \search error\"" every other day. Have to download the \nthesaurus and wordnet again and again."""
4078	5	a	Perfect app. merci pr cette app.
4079	4	a	Great app but they need to add the pronunciation to the words, just some information that should be on all word definitions
4080	2	a	Browser in een app. Niet touch vriendelijk
4081	5	a	Geography has never been so entertaining
4082	5	a	I love this Fighting Aircraft Battle HD game. It is high quality game with realistic jet models and challenging battles. Arcade games are my favourite and this game is favourite of all. I have lot of fun playing this game and now I am addicted to it.  Its very interesting . My friends also liked this game very much . I recommend this game to all.
4083	4	a	Some of this app's basic functions are still a bit dodgy, but it can, at least in theory, give one control over one's acoustic environment to a degree only dreamed of by home audiophiles.  Of course, this presupposes one has invested profligatly in UE speakers. Still, if one has even a single UE Boom, the app is certainly worth a go.
4084	5	a	Nice, simple to use and effective for our 3 year old. A bug is that the time-based lock out screen seems to come up even when it's an allowed time.
4085	5	a	Even I swipe it fast, it doesn't seem to follow my fingers. And I suggest that apps can be grouped in the way of changing bottom tabs like the widget section. So I can group apps into different tabs.  One more thing, hiding apps in app drawer doesn't mean hiding apps in favourite. One another thing, the header can be more informative like showing next alarm and next calendar event. When applied icon pack, icon sometimes show in a weird way(colours changed, like when icons are clicked and turn blue in window
4086	2	a	Would give 5 stars if there is an update
4087	5	a	Best 3d zombie game bt controller works if you guys ever update make a setting to remove crosshair or put it more on target, crosshair floats causes eye strain
4088	5	a	Hasn't crashed yet.  Perfect restroom break fun.
4089	5	a	Don't have to say anything wow!
4090	1	a	I used Micromax A89  This app open in mobile not more than 5 time Unexpectedly app not show anything after open otherwise app is really very good.
4091	1	a	Now i dwnld this game i try to play
4092	5	a	Its the best lwp I ever saw! It is so fun and there are more options than I know what to do with! Its worth double its price! A perfect buy!
4093	1	a	Just displays a dark strip on screen
4094	4	a	There is only one thing that keeps this game from five stars and perfect. The boosts are too high to make it flow. Otherwise this game is the best
4095	5	a	Very useful and user friendly guide to major gospel concepts with cross references  that solve doctrinal dilemmas.
4096	1	a	Ini check resi apa check iklan ya? Di klik yang nongol cuma iklan, ditunggu lama tapi tracking nya gak nongol-nongol.
4097	5	a	For your loved ones. ..
4098	2	a	After picking a contact from the address book, it states how many addresses there are, but doesn't show them nor give any options to select one.
4099	5	a	So much fun n addictive game
4100	5	a	Great app to use when my 15 1/2 year old son is driving on a learners \npermit. So many things to watch for when driving \u0026 Speed Warning app helps \nus watch his speed without being a constant nag.
4101	5	a	I like it, when I get bored it's a good game.I wish I could buy the music for my phone though
4102	1	a	Nothing original or different about the original flappy bird, just cosmetic changes...
4103	1	a	Yeah game bahut hi achha hai bhai
4104	1	a	Get this ratchet app off the market. I try with my account email and password but it doesn't recognize it... I try with my account number and password and it says my no internet..??
4105	3	a	It's ok but they need more options to use it's ok for it to have purchases but It should have a little bit of every pack please change it
4106	3	a	Looks interesting, but are the black and white pieces supposed to keep flipping sides?
4107	1	a	Not work for me from india
4108	2	a	Até funciona, mas agora que o Muambator lançou o aplicativo oficial já migrei para ele pois além de prestigiar a galera que realmente fez essa ferramenta espetacular, ainda tem suporte da equipe Muambator para qualquer coisa.  Procure pelo app oficial do Muambator! ;)
4109	2	a	i can'not download it because is say i don't have space , you should say if the app takes up more then 1 kb or if it can be put on the sd card ?!?!
4110	5	a	Excellent!  Characters are so cute!  Takes lots of practice to master!!
4111	3	a	Need offline mode and ability to detect best route
4112	2	a	Does not install on galaxy tab s2. Love using this on my phone but would be even better on my tablet. It downloads but runs into an error while Installing.
4113	2	a	Wish that you didn't consider android users as a 2nd thought.  I really would love some of the same features,  and after playing on my daughter's ipad, i just don't play the teamlava games as often anymore because of that.
4114	1	a	Use this app of you want irrelevant notifications of trivial events. I want to know about EMERGENCIES not trivia. Not good enough, Dept of Justice, resubmit.
4115	5	a	His mods works but for me a lot of them don't I download them but it doesn't show in zipper. I don't know why but it does like other ones. But still five out of five because I know he worked hard so no hate again his mods work! My tablet won't show it in zipper how dumb is my tablet?
4116	5	a	Please start playing this game
4117	5	a	Very very very good ....like
4118	2	a	when i  downloaded  this  game  i  did  everything  they told  me  to  do  but on the login page again again Oops  ur  password  is  very  short.
4119	1	a	成日都load 唔到就話網絡問題，網絡邊有問題，基本whatsapp n browsing 都得，係得你唔得之麻。檢討下啦！
4120	5	a	This is cute theme 👍
4121	1	a	To many ads that pop up

4123	1	a	Doesnt stream MKV movie files to chromecast !! Sends but fails to a screen with little blue chromecast logo in centre screen
4124	1	a	I have the galaxy s3 and it doesn't recognize the media player.. it says no track loaded and I'm using the default media player
4125	5	a	Coolest game ever in my whole life!
4126	1	a	Why Is Everyone Out To Make A Buck ??? We Should Have The Option To Use All The Widgets Just Like The Paid Version !!! The Paid Version Should Have Way More Widgets And Options Than It Does. Tightwads !!! I Have A Galaxy S4.
4127	4	a	Its nice . Allll d besttttt Dudes
4128	4	a	This game fill up my childhood memories
4129	1	a	This thing is not a game i hate it it is not a game do not install it.This is what the game is 😈😠😥😱😯
4130	5	a	The only thing that I have a problem with is the personalizing setting, on my samsung galaxy reverb. It won't show my pics anymore.
4131	5	a	Must light weight and simple way to show your albums as background.
4132	3	a	Allows you to use this as ringtone and alarm tone. However alarm does not \noften come on in this version. So, unreliable.
4133	4	a	I said it befote and i'll say it again. Question 4.2 about the wheel either has wrong info or the game's answer is incorrect. Please fix this.
4134	1	a	Maybe its just me, but has no landscape for asus tablet not one of my cams work, and i dave tgree
4135	4	a	One of the best free ones I found. I liked all the choices.
4136	4	a	Love the theme, except for the lack of no battery text!  I hate to have to run a separate app just to see what my battery is at.  Maybe one day this could be fixed.... :)
4137	5	a	This is amazing. Very fun and thoughtful. Are you contemplating ever adding full immersive mode?
4138	4	a	I like the demon elmo monster.  Its colorful and a lot of movements and music so you won't get bored. Oh yeah and lota of flashing. All the elements of a very nice short pixel game.
4139	5	a	I have not been on my tarot cards lately but I will with this app. I can continue. I love it and it is spot on and helped with clear meanings and you can save your readings.
4140	5	a	Great update, love the details about timing.
4141	5	a	This game is so awesome! I love the story \u003c3 It even made me cry :) I just wish that there will be a chapter that they both end up together :(
4142	1	a	My sis bought this and she got mad cause how it turned out she said the game was so stupid

4144	5	a	I have 2 youtube chanels ethan pearson and oriana pearson
4145	4	a	But want to get rid of adverts
4146	5	a	This app has saved me from a few scams. Great for calculating all kinds taxes quickly.
4147	2	a	Seems to be stuck because of an ad for another slots game.  Been playing the same rooms for weeks. Got full collection in them all but no new room opening up. If it isn't fixed soon I'm uninstalling. Shame cos I enjoyed it 😕.
4148	5	a	It is very nice game and I love it very very much
4149	2	a	" now I barely will use the app."""

4152	4	a	The game is fun and hasn't been lagging at all
4153	5	a	U guyz r superb. Looking nice one....
4154	1	a	This app is useless on my Nexus 6. The pullout menu is completely blank and the app frequently freezes.
4155	5	a	I love this game awesome game! !??
4156	5	a	Super fun way to mess with gullible people- the custom answer section is great!
4157	3	a	The app has good information and is a nice research start,  but the map in it is blurry and useless.
4158	1	a	I think i found something missing in my body
4159	4	a	The only thing is that I can't play on my G4 for some reason! This is my favorite mobile game but it just crashes everytime I open it on my G4. I don't know how to fix it. But anyone else who wants to try it out, it's really cool and addictive!
4160	5	a	Its really a good story  but I think if there could ne a read tome button then it would be great than ever
4161	2	a	Used to for years and it was great. Then latest update won't let me in - cannot change my password even with the link trying three times. Have now lost years of diabetic information. Will try and find a more reliable app for tracking diabetes.

4169	1	a	Waist of time and data stupid game to try to play it will keep jumping off can't be played for no more then two minutes kmft
4170	4	a	I will rate 5 when you get a 2x so then you can make it last 30 seconds so make a power up
4171	1	a	It won't even let me use the app so don't waste your time
4172	3	a	My kids love it it gets boring for me
4173	4	a	I started out with the sequel and they are somewhat alike. The sequel gives more emphasis to it's gauntlet style mechanics while this play more like the DND arcade game of old. It's fun, layered and varied. Adds system is ok, and Facebook integration is a plus (and optional, you don't have to). However I found the mechanics a little harder to get used to. Will play a little more...

4176	2	a	Very very steampunk :) BUT, doesn't work in my device, just leaves a blank screen \u0026 doesn't actually take the place as the wallpaper. Samsung Galaxy Core 2.
4177	1	a	makes you give 5 star rating to unlock stuffnthat doesn't even let you choose how your slideshow is
4178	3	a	Good content. Too much ads, annoying.
4179	1	a	Very hard to use when not all function keys are visible on the keypad especially being so long ago since using one
4180	5	a	A better time killer Loads of fun And didnt even use one also hint!!!!
4181	3	a	i like this for being simple theme for my sms😉😉😉
4182	1	a	3 letters from Arabic language are missing in this keyboard: ء ئ ؤ  please add them since you can not write Arabic without them!
4183	4	a	Really like the idea, but I am having a few problems. I have failed a few waves and it sent me down two levels, but the difficulty doesn't revert back down to the appropriate difficulty for my level. It becomes frustrating since they keep destroying my arrow towers and I keep dying, meaning I can't progress. My domestic hogs keep dying even though I feed them and give them water constantly. Otherwise, it's a great game and an effective time-killer.
4184	5	a	This app puts me to sleep every time I use it. It is just what I wanted, wind sounds with no music.
4185	1	a	Doesn't work worth a darn. Worthless. Pull from market!
4186	4	a	Alapvetően jól működő program, miután kiismertük, könnyen és gyorsan lehet vele keresni és jegyet vásárolni. Viszont szerintem komoly probléma, hogy ha a vonaton gyenge a térerő, lassú és akadozó a net, hiába volt egyszer már letöltve a telefonra, újra próbálja tölteni a jegyet, ami persze nem sikerül neki. A már letöltött jegyet azonnal meg kellene jelenítenie, és majd a háttérben frissítsen, ha tud. A megjelenített QR kód leolvasásával is sokszor van problémája a jegyvizsgálóknak, ezen is javítani kellene.
4187	1	a	Doesnt work on my galaxy s
4188	1	a	You guys keep having crashes on this game and your buttons to walk don't work. Secondly this is a terrible game it does not take 6 shots per zombie kill waste if you ask me.   Don't waste the time it takes to download it
4189	4	a	This game is really fun and addicting but PLEASE can you make atleast one of the cycling events free then I will give it 5 stars!!
4190	3	a	Shouldn't there be two factor authentication on this app by now?
4191	1	a	Misspelled words, even when you find everything and don't use hints it never gives 3 stars. Hate it and deleting.
4192	5	a	Family Budget - I hope to see more from you.
4193	5	a	I remember reading there was going to be a sequal to sweet scandal and im so happy its finally here! I loved the original when I finished Amasawa's route, I loved the detailed story and i cant wait for the new adventure in this one :D
4194	5	a	Love it great was to stay tuned
4195	5	a	I love it but i do t like that u have to pay to start over where you where that is. Just dump but that is the only thing i dont like about this game. Everything else is so good but if the person who made the game read this. Can you chang that bc i dont think thar is fair yes i know my review was not short but long but it was something i Had to say hope you get this byeeeeeeee
4196	2	a	" making the device completely useless until an internet connection is available again.  Please somebody reverse engineer the protocol and write an app that works!"""
4197	3	a	Please make all your games free because I don't have enough money to buy all of them, so please do it because they are so addictive.
4198	3	a	It takes a lot of work to unlock things so I think that more things should be unlocked
4199	3	a	A big thank you to this app developerfor their quick response and explanation on how to Change to the correct currancy symbol. I now gladly change this very helpfull app to a five star rating.
4200	3	a	Cancel button is ignored/ has no effect if Location is disabled or Airplane mode is enabled. Of course for the app to work both of these must be set correctly, but still it's a bug if just testing the app.
4201	4	a	Any picture I take with front facing camera gets blurred as if a paint was dropped on the picture and spread outwards
4202	1	a	Most ridiculous game I've ever played
4203	5	a	I  love  this  game we are playing  the  game  and it is hard  to play but it is fun
4204	5	a	Im expecting more in the future in this app developers.
4205	5	a	I LOVE LUV LUFF JE ADORE JE SUIS INFATUATED I AM CRAZY INSANE 4 THIS APPLICATION IT SHOWS US GOD'S CREATION...MOTHER EARTH...IN ALL HER GLORY...IT IS SPELLBINDING ...A WONDERFUL MARRIAGE OF CREATIVE TECHNOLOGY AND REAL LIFE FULL COLOUR HIGH DEFINITION MOTHER NATURE AND EARTH BY NIGHT AND DAY...
4206	5	a	This game is so fun and scary
4207	1	a	Anything ;never download this game; directly its starts and we cannot choose the cars
4208	4	a	20 mo old loves it, but I can't get the other 6 puzzles to open.
4209	1	a	Doesn't work, it takes forever to load
4210	1	a	One of the waste app
4211	5	a	I lost my wifi when screen is off...and now it won't happen any more.. you solve  it ...!!! Thx buddy
4212	4	a	Loved it but becomes repetitive meaning there's no reason to play but also problems with scrolling on the map take away from expeditions.Adding a storyline and making a bigger map would help make it more interesting. Adding more village capacity or enabling other villages to be made would add to making the game more interesting.
4213	4	a	Easy to create card on the go
4214	1	a	Will not load on 2 different devices. Stops at 34% please fix!
4215	5	a	It does what I want it to do.
4216	4	a	This game is AWESOME. There's just two things not so good. The battles should increase to eight, AND the time to gain another battle shouldn't be one when it reaches zero. Increase it to exactly half. I'LL KNOW 😠. If you can do this I'll rate five stars and I mean it. Also do a special Christmas dragon, please.
4217	4	a	Please add more recipes of Gujarati Shak
4218	1	a	Error 927 came up when I tried to download
4219	1	a	Dnt dnld...its too easy...and auto players r worthless....
4220	1	a	The game doesn't go beyond the creator graphic screen at the very start. It crashes immediately. Super deadly to itself, at least.
4221	5	a	Its good and very usefull.
4222	5	a	This is best game I have played in a very long time!
4223	1	a	Vec drugu partiju mi kida, prekida, vrijeme tece a ne pokazuje mi se, protivnik odigra pola igrice dok se meni uopste prikaze. Uzas. I spojnice su preglupe ne znam ko ih smislja ali samo neka ste zdravo.
4224	3	a	It's a nice game and if only I could understand the language
4225	5	a	itss soo coool... i have idea to develop it...
4226	3	a	The app loads quickly and does have a variety of topics. I think it would be good to have an equal number of conservative and liberal sources when it comes to politics. Having an editorial or opinion from a source labeled as such, is a good thing.
4227	5	a	Really fun and creative without invasive ads and it doesn't  cook my phone by overheating. I've had it now for a year and a half no problem don't trip on the negative nellys you be the judge.
4228	3	a	DON'T PURCHASE THIS APP! It has justification Iissues where text overlaps text- and saved dates are wrong for correct record keeping.Issues need fixing. Appears app was coded without any quality control before release.
4229	4	a	I like this app. Easy to use and has all contact information fields. One star removed because you can only enter one phone number. Increase to at least three; cell, home, and work.  Then this will be a 5 star app IMO.
4230	5	a	It's awesome but I don't know how to buy stuff when I run out of food
4231	5	a	before race i can change parts of the car
4232	4	a	This game is amazing there is no stopping for adverts like other games have and you can enjoy although bees and butterflies spoil it as it is hard to remember what you should do with each character either  leave it to crawl or kill it so I rate this game 4 stars
4233	5	a	I bought the Premium Version of this app a long time ago and now its no longer a premium.. whats the purpose of it going to free? I am glad there is no ads from what I see so far. And the interface looks better than the premium did. Thank You so much.
4234	5	a	It did what big apps like Google docs and office mobile couldn't do...it opened my document with formulas and special characters in it!!...would be even better if it support images
4235	1	a	To many adds. Shouldn not haft to pay money to stop them. Uninstalling. What a joke. Hardly any wins. What a joke!!!!
4236	4	a	Very pretty  and realistic
4237	5	a	Can you please make another one because this theme is very nice
4238	5	a	Use it to teach my son how to read an analog clock. Go figure, 21st century kids
4239	5	a	A lot of fun and very entertaining, highly recommend
4240	5	a	So nice apps very useful
4241	1	a	Estou a tentar registar-me e o email com o código de informação não está a ser enviado, o que impossibilita a utilização do cartão.
4242	1	a	Played Summoners War and screen said to log into Hive to protect data.  Piece of $%#\u0026 keeps failing.  Deleted game deleted Hive account.  To make a new Hive account I had to create a new Gmail account.  Created new Hive account, installed Summoners war, same $%#\u0026 account conversion failed.  I will not try again.  I will not play any Hive linked games.
4243	5	a	My two year old loves this game!
4244	1	a	I use to be able to watch live matches through this app. Now when you try \nto sign in you get an error message that many other people seem to be \ngetting. However, looking at the low rating this app has it appears that \nTennis Channel doesn't seem to care enough to fix the issue. If you are \npaying for TC plus I really feel sorry for you because it is not worth it \nwith these issues.
4245	2	a	This game is fun and all but it keeps crashing and its really annoying. Also when I log out to play a different game and log back in I have to restart the whole game! Plz fix then I will give it at least 3 stars
4246	3	a	The images look nice but at least for me they are too intense to be used as backgrounds. And looking at them too much almost gives me a seizure.
4247	3	a	It's simple but effective.  Thank you
4248	5	a	It's OK.. like ant smash but with levels, I like it.
4249	5	a	I use it all the time for a quick look at futures. works great.
4250	3	a	Pretty good has a god variety of kpop songs. Kind of organized but REALLY needs to be up to date with songs \u0026 artists
4251	2	a	While as a basic word processor it excels, ultimately Writer falls short. It is near impossible to export your documents, even with the use of a file manager. This severely limits the use of the app. If such a feature existed, I would be much more generous with my rating, as it is really quite a nice mobile processor. It can be used offline, which is a blessing. But as I said, the lack of exporting options makes this app fall behind. It might be useful as a notepad or something, but I don't think most people will get much use out of it.
4252	1	a	Worst game I have ever played  Who tells that its a nice game
4253	2	a	This app does not have all the mcdonald food menu
4254	1	a	When this app first came out i loved it. I used it for 2 years with great success. Keeping track of progress was easy  and the diets were easy to follow. Now with all of the changes nothing works anymore. I will be searching for a new app.
4255	3	a	Yet overall it makes me very happy to see more eo apps. Make more! We need games!
4256	3	a	This watch face is designed for square watches. The battery meters are in the two bottom corners, so they're not visible on my Moto 360. I'd also like to have more options to choose colors. I wanted to choose the same color for two items and I couldn't choose the exact same color for both using the color wheel. Otherwise, the design is very nice, and I appreciate that it's available for free!
4257	5	a	This is so beautiful app 4 lovers. By the way this is sooooooo good
4258	1	a	why wont this open on my computer it keeps saying its compatiable with all my devices but wont open
4259	2	a	טעינת הקופונים מיותרת ואורכת יותר מידי זמן. תנו את הקופונים וזהו, בלי לטעון אותם. או שלכל הפחות תנו אפשרות חסמן את כל הקופונים ולטעון בבת אחת.
4260	5	a	May LORD ALMIGHTY blessed the wallpaper creator.... Amen
4261	3	a	still 0^0 \u003d 1. It should be ‘error’. And please put mod operation so we can find modulo of a number.
4262	5	a	Liking this gaem sooo veri much!!  ... Oomg I must brush-up my english (or NOT!)  You rock! \\(._.\\)
4263	5	a	Thanks for the 1st class app.!
4264	3	a	I like the new look and being able to edit individual items - even list names at last! Thank you! However, now one list stays open all the time. No matter what list I open, when I leave the app it reverts to that one. I don't want that or any other list displayed all the time.  I'm concerned about accidentally deleting something from whatever one is open. I will try deleting and reinstalling.   Well, obviously THAT didn't work. I lost all my lists. Stupid of me. Done with the app
4265	4	a	Very  very good item
4266	5	a	It has covered all SA news papers,  like it.
4267	1	a	I wish I could give it negative stars
4268	1	a	Half the time I open my phone to a blank widget space on my homepage. Pretty much defeats the entire purpose.
4269	5	a	Jzt waao n love eit
4270	1	a	How to connect it ?
4271	1	a	Tried multiple numbers where I knew the location, doesnt work at all and full of ads
4272	2	a	Randomly, some corrected words are still underlined in red.
4273	4	a	collection are awesome.. quality of music superb.. app design..search.. data provisions are great... but 1. poor streaming... 2. more buffering (should be like youtube ..what a strong streaming) 3. new albums getting delay to list out in Raaga 4. no supporting team.. customer care nil.
4274	5	a	Wow!!! Really good app to me and our family members...... When I did not \nunderstand my date of birth in Islamic calendar this app helped me........
4275	5	a	Five Nights at Freddy's has to be my biggest fandom and my favourite game. I love horror and this game is scarily awesome! I have the demo because my tablet is not that good and probably won't be able to cope with the full thing, but I'm getting all four games on my computer asap. FNAF 3 has been very successful and has never crashed (it did lag once but I think that was my fault) and it's a great game. Enjoy!
4276	5	a	Great source of catholic informations in a single click....for excellence...there can option for other oriental language like Tamil...
4277	5	a	This helped me a lot! I had a lot of trouble passing a traditional drawing onto a digital one, it's really good!
4278	1	a	Was excited to finally have this game on android...but too many issues..partner has other cards of same suit but plays Mendi on other teams ace...partner is cut on a suit where Mendi is played but doesn't or can't use trump...for some odd reason only I can open trump..doesn't display which Mendi is gone so have to memorize it..
4279	5	a	THIS APPS IS VERY NICE..
4280	1	a	Tried to use  but it crashes straight away.  Uninstalled ..
4281	5	a	Dear Ssundee , you are the best youtuber and if I could meet you in real life it would be an honor so when you play minecraft or clash of clans when I am sad I watch your vids and I feel happy and warm inside, and you are helping me through a tough time so thank you so much and you are my favorite youtuber.
4282	1	a	This is a fake app it doesn't show anything when installed i think anyone mustn't download this app!!!!!
4283	1	a	Doesn't work on Android 8
4284	2	a	Was great app until I changed to OnePlus phone and now fails. Tried contacting lumowell but no reply.
4285	5	a	Appeared to stop working but it was an external SD card write problem causing it.
4286	3	a	Pls add more pictures for the free version. Why would anybody pay for this app for just 6 pictures?
4287	3	a	If you want an updated Elite clone with new graphics, this may be it.  So why does it not pull you in? Beastly complicated menu, short tutorial, hints page is hard to find, space feels claustrophobic. On the good side combat is better than average, doable at first, anyway. No one deserves any money yet, that much is clear.
4288	1	a	I LOVE this app, but ever since the update it won't load. I hope you fix it soon, because I miss reading your articles.
4289	5	a	Short circuits made me sweat
4290	1	a	It's trash. It duplicates entries and unable to delete or make corrections. You cant enter your blood sugar without having to enter carbs. The options to enter food suck as well. would not recommend ro anyone
4291	1	a	Kids shouldn't download this if they let you dig and brush the dirt off the dinosaur and let you have points to unlock other dinosaurs it would be better but still boringggggggg
4292	2	a	The ads in the game are on the bottom and they cover the bubbles
4293	4	a	not too much like to learn more
4294	2	a	Information given is very detailed and technical however the storage numbers are way off. This app was last updated in 2013, it is now November 2018 and it reports my 128GB SD card as a 500MB card. Update sorely needed.
4295	1	a	Iam giving a award to this app that is world's unlimited waste apps
4296	2	a	Weryfikacja bazy słów by się przydała. ..
4297	1	a	This game is trash you can't do tricks
4298	1	a	Doesn't work well on touch screens. You have to tap to select but then you need to press either 1or 3 to rotate! Bit hard to do if there's no key pad :-/
4299	1	a	Jeg forventer bedre av NRK
4300	2	a	Model ends up in the way of the parts break down and I can't see what I need. The steps are too large to follow without scouring the image for ten minutes. I had high hopes for this one but was severely disappointed
4301	4	a	Sehir hatlari tarifelerinin guncellenmesi gerekiyor
4302	4	a	I'm glad they still make mystery games with stories. You can't find them anywhere. So thank you!!
4303	2	a	Beautiful art. Mediocre storytelling. Terrible slow and cumbersome gameplay. Gave up at the tilt magnet bit because it was impossible to control.
4304	1	a	physics raped by Paulo Coelho
4305	1	a	i can't game start n connect server error. so solve it server error......
4306	3	a	3 star because this did not read my lrc file.. Suggestion for future are: controllable lyric color and size, scan SD,, and if you guys could incorporate basic mp3 player this app is gonna be winner
4307	3	a	Looks great. New concept. However you need a 5 min loop not 5 seconds. The video jumps to much to be realistic
4308	5	a	Tai hao la.that is great!
4309	2	a	I couldn't find it on my phone. This was a problem for others, too. Maybe its only for a certain kind of phone?
4310	5	a	Kepp getting my darn fingers cut off though...  Give it a try, but be quick with your fingers!
4311	5	a	You know this game could continue with the main character fighting back against anger. Or when on the angry side he can kill enemy's.                                                                                     .                 please take my suggestions into your suggestion.    .            OK?  You still there? If you're still here then  I appreciate it :)
4312	4	a	Download this app its pretty accurate
4313	1	a	sanirim web siteye baglaniyor oyuzden cok yavas
4314	3	a	It looks thrill and think cooooollll
4315	5	a	Great to have access to the app permissions that our friends at Google hid from us who use KK
4316	1	a	" it does nothing. Frustrating!"""
4317	5	a	This is the most beautiful winter wallpaper I have found! Love it! Looks just like some places near where we live.
4318	4	a	This app will only detect if your device is vulnerable. The fix must come from your service/mobile phone provider. It's usually an OTA update. If your system doesn't have any updates and it says you are open to attack? You should turn off MMS on your texting until your provider sends a patch download. That's all...
4319	1	a	don't wanna let mi open iht
4320	5	a	J'ai pas reçu mon mot de passe???
4321	1	a	Is just a gif moving
4322	1	a	Please do not waste your time on this piece of crap
4323	2	a	No options to remove ads!? Frustrating! I'll keep my little paper ref booklet for now
4324	4	a	I use the site frequently and just downloaded the app today. I will update my rating based on the service throughout the time I use it.
4325	1	a	This was very  boring
4326	5	a	Thank you so much ! Love this apps 👏 👏 👏 👏 💕 😉 💋
4327	5	a	Excellent app.light n can use easily. I recommend.
4328	3	a	I have a Nexus 6P. The app will often crash upon start, will have to be closed and restarted several times before my purchased lessions will load properly. Even though I downloaded lessions, it will require an internet connection not only for account verification, it starts streaming. This eats a lot of the data I tried not to use by downloading lessions beforehand while I was on wifi. I end up not even practicing until I get back to my desktop computer, which might be twice a week. Not currently happy.
4329	5	a	Looks good on my nitro
4330	5	a	Its so cool to play. It just takes your mind off things...but i have noticed 1 problem...you need to get the premuim version. I hope the people who make this game see this... its so awesome and its decent unlike other games that show ads all the time. I would totally recomend this game it is worth downloading and it runs really smoothly so there are no hassels while playing this game. It is a AWESOME time killer and it is really something so good to play. 5/5
4331	1	a	U can't even skate straight its like a glitch game
4332	1	a	Dont download this game it's the wrost game ever
4333	5	a	Must have for anyone that needs/wants to know anything at all about they're device,also I can see this very useful in narrowing down issues one may have in the way they're hardware is performing .
4334	4	a	It was not the best but not very fun ither
4335	1	a	Does this app work on Android? What pin number??? I.d number does not work.
4336	5	a	Best tracking app I have used.
4337	1	a	Flylikeabird3 way better you be a bird fly around forage for food build nests lay eggs raise chicks and meet other birds in multiplayer mode
4338	5	a	Loved it..keep it up guyz you just made a girl happy😇😘
4339	5	a	Good game but gives constant tutorials on each game. I purchased the no add version expecting no tutorials... stick with FREE one guys as no need to play online.. as it's only stats that needed. To be fair it's most realistic pool game I've played. Most realistic pool game
4340	5	a	Perfect for blind shots, getting an idea on yardage to trouble, or any other situation where you might not be able to use a laser range finder. Not fancy, but all you need.
4341	5	a	Yes love this app!!! To see my son use this app is great! Now he has something on a tablet that he can do! May not be for some But is helpful for my son!!Thanks!!
4342	5	a	So helpful for students!!! Highly recommended
4343	1	a	Won't let you enter data unless you get a subscription for $5 a month. Doesn't say that in description. Total waste of my time.
4344	3	a	Nice app...keep on adding new ukhane....
4345	3	a	I really love this game but there's 2 things thats making disappointing.   1. There's a bug with your inventory depending on were you touch on your slots it comes out your inventory your character moves on the screen.   2. There's a bug with multiplayer mode when you join your friends it freezes it allows you to interact with your hud but but If you touch the floor to move or try to interact with you equipment its just frozen.   I really would like this sorting with the next update an I would definitely give this game a 5 star it a great game.
4346	5	a	Definitely love the images and the captures of such unique creatures
4347	5	a	Jai hindi salute to national anthem...♥B-)
4348	1	a	Seit dem update ist das so unbrauchbar langsam, bis das offen ist hab ich bei der kicker app schon alles gelesen. Grauenhaft.
4349	4	a	SImple little app for tracking your goals. It was a bit difficult to figure out how to use at first but that might just be me. So far it has been very helpful in keeping me on track with my goals!
4350	1	a	This app doesn't work.  Every time I go to use it, it says md practice driving has stopped. This is very frustrating considering that I re-downloaded this app to see if it would work but nothing has changed.
4351	5	a	Fun and easy to learn.
4352	4	a	tipi is missing  as in  Punjabi first word of this letter is a cap type symbol represents n sound.. isnsted there is Hindi symbol.
4353	3	a	Besides it cutting off every second, it's fine
4354	4	a	Would have given one more star had the app not kept crashing every time I tried to take a picture for my study cards. Besides that, this is perfect! Just one suggestion. If you guys could provide an option for noting down the days topics before getting started on them. Like a timetable, it would be really great. Also, please increase the days target study hours. I'm required to study 10 hours a day haha :$
4355	4	a	I feel crazy these game. It's so scared
4356	1	a	I liked the previous app. Hate thos one
4357	1	a	Rrif reklama se ne mice sa ekrana sto god pritisnuo.Kad sam vec pomislio da su one reklame s Vipom pretjerane.Fuj srozali ste se losega na smece nesto tipa nas kreditni rejting.
4358	1	a	There is something wrong with the app, it stops on startup and never open.. on note II
4359	5	a	Enjoy keeping my mind active and this game really challenges my thinking and keeps my mind active. Thank you.
4360	5	a	It is nice powerful one you should try it
4361	4	a	Good app.However,I suggest a 'Search' option should be included.
4362	4	a	Right Choice for all. THANKS.
4363	5	a	I just needed a good scary story!
4364	5	a	I can't stop plugin my charger in and out of the phone I have already broken py charger pin
4365	2	a	I would go to do something. And it was like it had its own brain. It did its own thing. I couldnt make it work
4366	4	a	I like it this is so nice I love it
4367	5	a	Been using this theme since I got my phone about a yr ago. Great theme! Check out his other color themes too
4368	5	a	Please add the individual hand odds if you can. Eg, breaking down the odds of winning into odds of making pair, flush...etc
4369	4	a	" why would you require handling my calls? Makes no sense to me.. Great game though."""
4370	4	a	Who would think you can play a 47.96 GB game on a f**king phone!?! These people just makes me wish an asteroid hit the earth and everyone is dead!
4371	5	a	This is exactly what I have been looking for. Provides both American and British english sounds and charts, very user friendly.
4372	3	a	It is so much harder to play this game than playing an actual drum
4373	5	a	I love this app this is good wallpaper the beeeest
4374	4	a	Great stories, awesome dialogues! Slightly crappy controls but manageable. However the episodes are a tad expensive. Considering the game is already years old, and the gameplay being rather simple, I'd expect the full season pass to cost at most two third of its price right now. Anyway, since I played the first season on the PS4, is there a way for this app to obtain savegames from there though?
4375	1	a	Force closes when I try to get past the intro. Not able to use the app. Moto g4
4376	4	a	It really makes you spend some time on it. Like the idea. Don't really like the design in my opinion it could have been more clean but this is just personal. Good job!
4377	3	a	i would give it a 5 star, but i cant because if i want to sing offline i have to pay. But the thing is, i dont have those type of credit cards and plus my mother will kill me if i ask for her credit card lol. (She doesnt support my dreams) So that pay thing kind of bugs me.
4378	5	a	The app makes it easy for u  to pray to ur creator. May Allah reward u in so many ways amin.
4379	3	a	Its cute and fun but.... there are some set backs. I feel like the adds just pop up way too much. Also its kind of sensitive when it comes to releasing your bird. A tenth of a second too long and your bird hits the ceiling and if its too short then you dont make it. No middle ground.
4380	1	a	How do you team if you can't have friends 😈👿👹👺💀☠😬💩👎👎💔💢💥💣⛈☔🌊💧🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎮🎮🎮👎👎👎👎👎
4381	4	a	I have been getting lots of scam calls for some lady I've never heard of. Nothing gives me more satisfaction than being able to add any new scam numbers to Blacklist and watching them be blocked as they try to harass me multiple times a day. Love this app. Only issue is that it still lets the number ring once before hanging up on them, so if the scammers call at an inconvenient time my phone still goes off briefly.
4382	2	a	The controls are difficult and the jump and crouch are practically useless in combat. The whole combat system is just button mashing trying to drain your enemies health first, nothing else to it.
4383	5	a	Good game, it is really fun to play, but just add some new game modes. :-D
4384	3	a	Same thing all the time, just bombing stuff.and only one map
4385	4	a	This is a fun game. I like the multiple choice of answers to the ? 's
4386	3	a	This app doesn't work in off screen how we use it
4387	4	a	I like this game a lot, but that's only because of the lack of realistic Emergency Games. This game is the closest you can currently get on Android. Improvements                            1) Please have a setting to change the siren, maybe even give the player the freedom to upload use there own...          2) Turn of sirens but keep lights on. 3) Functional Mirrors 4) Emergency Horn 5) Turn Signals (We aren't all BMW Drivers) 6) More Ambulance Skins 7) Better AI (Lack of yeilding to Blue Lights)
4388	5	a	Want a full complete game without those pesky and awful micro-transactions? This is it! This is the best mobile adaptation of any game I have played. The only exception is the camera swipe controls but this is easily avoided using the provided drop down controls for the camera. The game sadly plays better on my phone then on my old outdated computer! Looks great for a mobile app plays well and has so much content for only 12bucks. This is a must buy whether you already own the game on another platform or not! Stop thinking and buy this now.
4389	5	a	Fabulous app! I love fireworks and never get tired of watching them.
4390	5	a	I can be anywhere and listen to my fav station
4391	5	a	איך מתקינים את זה? ??
4392	2	a	Please state it's a demo, i know its in the details but it woukd be nice if it was on app icon. overall was decent, needs some more work. No item description or room description, no text explained as how to play. Also seems the developer was unkind to one person who disliked the game,  don't want to deal with that,very unprofessional,  as it was most likely a young kid, that said my honest review is nice graphics,smooth game play,makes you hunt for objects.  Bad part is no item description, no room identifi
4393	4	a	Die App wäre besser, wenn man seinen eigenen persönichen Stundenplan hinzufügen könnte.
4394	2	a	" no problems. Why can't I access remotely? Website issues? What's the deal? I want to monitor remotely while away for the holidays and can't."""
4395	5	a	I love it! Great design and nice Christmas music,  great free apps to download inside. Looking forward for Advent 2014!
4396	5	a	When I bought this app I was pleased with the functionality.  With the new features added in the update it is much easier to perform duties as an owner.  The only thing it needs to make it complete is to add in the ability to manage plugins and edit user logins.  Other than that I love this program on the server and this app.
4397	3	a	The app it's ok, but it would be awesome that  with the meaning of the phrasal verbs would come a statement in order to see the phrasal verbs in context.
4398	4	a	Provides several individual toggle buttons, each as a widget.  Also optional notification-area brightness and media-volume (not affecting ringer or other volumes) controls.  Confusingly, the installed icon and name are different from those here in the Play store.  If the brightness control in the notifications doesn't work, add a brightness control widget and tap it for a one-time permission granting (then you can remove the widget).
4399	3	a	iv only just added  it to me phone an it was asking 2 rate it need more time
4400	1	a	short cuts disappear don't use this app disappointing discusted dumb android
4401	5	a	As soon as I installed I took pics and no sound pics are good to very good. Great especially since my reg camera won't do silent.
4402	5	a	I tried to download this app but there is a problem in playstore
4403	4	a	Great app for controlling the brightness of my phone and prevent tired eyes. But make sure when you use it, don't turn it on too long as the instructions have specified.
4404	5	a	Nobody liked me until I downloaded this app. It really was hard for me when I saw everyone in their friend groups all talking about Desmos and leaving me out. So when I installed it suddenly I had some friends. I would definitely recommend this app for people that have no friends. Your truly NigNog
4405	5	a	Such a useful app, use it to tune my harps and figure out the notes. The only other thing I'd love to see is support for minor key harps, both natural and harmonic.
4406	4	a	Good app, but the notifications don't work? I keep missing ISS passes :(
4407	5	a	But the game is pretty fun and easy my little four year old loves it.
4408	4	a	I don't know about it
4409	4	a	Все просто и лаконично . Оч полезная вещь. Прозьба к улучшению - расширьте пожалуйста такое понятие как 'метод воздействия '!  Заранее Благодарю )
4410	1	a	Every app ad ever comes up
4411	3	a	It's really cool, but not what I was hoping for.
4412	5	a	My only complaint is that it changes some of the icons so much you can't tell what is what but after playing around you get used to it other then that beautiful theme fits who I am a free spirit keep up the great work!
4413	1	a	I download but ther is No go keyboard in my tabler
4414	1	a	Terrible. No menu works. No function.
4415	1	a	Can't connect to the server
4416	5	a	My Message, Phone, camera and Music app still doesn't have their own icons. That's just too name a few. I use Asus Zenfone. More icon packs are supporting all of their apps already.
4417	4	a	Thanks to give support from this app
4418	5	a	This is a good game 💋💋
4419	5	a	Simple effective way to see which way the markets will open
4420	5	a	This is the greatest game ever..Fun, Challenging, All kinds of things to catch. Recommend it for everyone young and old.. Try it you wont be sorry. Hats off to the makers.... :-)
4421	3	a	Good app Please add hindi language
4422	5	a	This player  is supporting almost all video formats.

4425	5	a	Downloaded this app and it's bloody brilliant . Great stuff well done  :-)
4426	5	a	I want this application to be connected on the facebook
4427	5	a	Excellent quality - looks really nice on my HTC One.
4428	2	a	Level 4 is impossible unless you follow an exact sequence from the start, I gave up after an hour. These games are supposed to be enjoyable, not tediously repetitive.
4429	1	a	Make more variety. When you actually have ESP, you will be tricked and always select wrong...
4430	5	a	Thank You for bringing this to our attention about a faker. I would like to purchase this App, but I refuse to use PayPal.  One $400.00 hacker in China thought I should buy him a $400.00 Cellphone. PayPal admitted that the company has over a million accounts hacked everyday around the world.  Is their another way? BTW I love this App!
4431	2	a	What happened to the wish list? I've been using this app for a few years.. it's my go to app because of the wish list.. ugh! So disappointed! Now have to start all over! Change it back plz.
4432	5	a	البرنامج اكثر من رائع .. ومن افضل البرامج الموجودة
4433	3	a	Tá no caminho certo, mas da muito conflito ainda, não teve uma vez sequer que tenha fechado normalmente aqui, todas foram por falha do app.
4434	1	a	Bila update yg terkini saya tidak dapat lihat surah al fatihah dan lain lainnya. Semua menjadi gelap.  I am using Samsung Duos.

4436	1	a	The app does NOT work!!! Just sits and loads forever!!! Really frusturating
4437	5	a	Completely free and everything I need to make a good flash card. I am never deleting this app. This is a must flash card app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4438	1	a	A complete  waste of time to download. Couldn't even get it to record.  User interface is deceptively easy but unclear and each button leads nowhere important.  I am still unsure how to use this app as the guide is as useless as the app.
4439	5	a	It's a very useful app , very fast and use friendly.....it's very much better than any other apps ...
4440	5	a	I'm uninsttaling cause I thought it was a hack
4441	3	a	Good interface and accurate scientific content, but unusable outside the US without the option to input standard units (mmol/L) for cholesterol levels.
4442	1	a	Very stupid game sucks those not work
4443	4	a	Tried Image Combiner and Photo Joiner and I believe this one's the best. Unfortunately no in-app cropping, which will be the only essential feature missing here in my opinion.
4444	5	a	Sir Everyday Science pattern par update karo. Nice and good app.
4445	2	a	Seems to work but is not consistent with my friends iPhone tracker. There is not total vertical feet skied and no way I found to upload results from a day skiing. After buying this app and using it for a day I uninstalled and found a better app.
4446	5	a	YOU WILL BE ROLLING AROUND THE FLOOR WITH LAUGHTER buy this app
4447	3	a	Would be better if there was some way to record your own audio to incorporate
4448	5	a	I have searched endlessly for an app to store my tasks and send me reminders, and I finally found it! This app truly is what it says it is. I would recommend it to everyone!
4449	4	a	It's a great app , but it hasn't got an offline radio , some bands are \nmissing, but I was able to find many latest songs and it's really good, I \nwould love to give a 5 star rating to this app but as I wasn't able to find \nsome vands , I gave it 4 stars. Hope you would add the remaining bands , \nthank you😁
4450	1	a	It gives option to create courses but i am not able to share it. Stupid.

4456	5	a	About 5 years from now My cousin visited us and i was playing his ipad when i saw this game then yesaterday it went in my mind that i would like to install this game,since i dont remember its name,i tried to type: corndog vendor,yes i dont know what i was typing but i finally found the game that i am looking for....
4457	1	a	If I could rate this app in the negative, I would. Extremely disappointed.
4458	1	a	I hate this game because it is on a time limit. I wanted adventure.
4459	5	a	I love it. I can see my abs a little bit more.
4460	5	a	The baby hazel Christmas game is very entertaining. I love the part when Santa comes. This is a very good game.😊
4461	5	a	Great way to know what's going on at the conference!
4462	5	a	Improvement with my daughters math !!!!
4463	1	a	The fact that people keep using the stereotype of Mexicans from the 1920s is racist, I can't believe all these people even write positive reviews in English and Spanish.
4464	2	a	Good try but it still needs improvement like physically changing the home button and so on changing color and wallpaper is not customizable I could do that without this
4465	5	a	Please make a beach with moving clouds and waves

4472	5	a	This is a great time killer  I highly recommend you get this game
4473	3	a	It freezes a lot before and while playing. On the home page it freezes, or when I click on any mode it freezes before going or freezes on the countdown. Also freezes during games. I have to keep closing it for it to work and it's annoying. Other than that, it is a great game. Please fix
4474	3	a	Was a great working app. But since KK came on the scene it does nothing but f/c. Any plans on fixing this? Moto XT926
4475	5	a	Really great app, does what its supposed to and its simple and easy to use.
4476	5	a	Small app, no bells and whistles,. But does its job well.
4477	5	a	Is working really good during this days. I hope continue good.
4478	5	a	I love the data I get from running the speed check. However, I constantly have to go in and activate the connection. It the app loses its activation info then it stops running in the background.
4479	3	a	I tryed to open my app and all it does is say lodeing and willnt do anything plz help  me.
4480	5	a	It's better 2 b on time with this professional app especially its security.Thanks \u0026 with the best regards.

4484	3	a	This app is OK mostly, but the text sizes are small and should have the ability to be edited.
4485	1	a	This is a very bad game the face of The Princess is very bad
4486	5	a	Solid live wallpaper! Low batt use great quality
4487	2	a	I do like this game however the steering controls are a pain in the butt .when they fix it ill gladly give it 5 stars.

4504	5	a	They are of good quality and looks nice as a wallpaper. There are 4 different choices, and all are good. I wish there was more. Anyways, it's a cool app. 😆
4505	4	a	This is really cool, yet kinda harder then temple run XD but I'll probably get the hang of it later on. This game was so cool!!!
4506	3	a	It's great but if you build the computer it don make a difference
4507	3	a	Make the hour hand SHORTER than it is please.
4508	4	a	Works great \u0026 easy to organize. Only issue is custom dice types: I can create them, but not use or add them to profiles.
4509	1	a	This is s very poor app. As others have said a massive down grade from previous app. It gives no confirmation of booking whereas previously you had a text and email. The credit card booking does not work and so I had to find cash. Sorry off to Speedline.
4510	4	a	Fantastic but why do u nedd to carry on by the full version,.your just making education worst
4511	4	a	I like it, definitely get some laughs from this app. BUT, it seems to kick me off a bit when scrolling through the names. Other then that, I like it.
4512	3	a	Solid game and nice music. It reminds a lot of Warcraft but without the multitude of characters, of course. The henchmen are nice but the AI is  simplistic. After a while it gets repetitive because there is not a clear campaign or storyline.
4513	3	a	In the newest update it shows that it supposed to change the theme of dial pad. But it didn't change in mine and still using basic theme. Explain why.
4514	5	a	This is a  amazing and wonderful app makes the shapes that you want +it has a timer for which you can make shapes awsm!!😀😁😀😁
4515	5	a	I was worried that it wouldn't work. Not all wear apps work on my 1st gen G Watch. I have to rotate the screen every time I use it, but very useful. At least it has the option to rotate.
4516	1	a	Try giving a trial. Time with all features unlocked so we can actually decide if we want it instead of just asking us to pay for it right out the bat to see if other features do work. Not worth the risk
4517	1	a	or technically inept people, *sign*  Would be cooler if it makes weird noises and has random sequences where the screen could close automatically. Kinda lame.  And the broken screen is totally fake as there is no emboss on the real screen(lol). Leak is so-so.
4518	4	a	This is a user friendly application...
4519	1	a	Worst voice keyboard ever  It doesn't has option even to open it
4520	5	a	This game is a blast. I like it very much. Nice game u can download it in your mobiles, tabs, etc. Have Fun..
4521	2	a	I am using samsung S4 and every time i try to click on the any tab, it suddenly stops. Please fix the bug
4522	4	a	Can you please add option to add pictures,  as well as drawing option (scribble)  the with eraser and clear all drawings option?   Will gladly pay 20$ if these features are added lol,  coz it will become the best and perfect  app,    Hope the dev reply to this ASAP,  Thanks!  (I'm a medical student and need those features lol)
4523	1	a	Pop up add nothing more
4524	5	a	I really liked toobz, simple mind numbing puzzle to waste away hours, but this is just better, goes on for longer and with lots of variety in game play. Might even get the full version for even more levels
4525	5	a	If you enjoy Aussie motor racing, you have to get this.
4526	5	a	Excellent and very nice game

4529	5	a	An awesome app first exercise i was already sweating i love this app, A must have.
4530	3	a	Gets three stars for attempting something.  But most of the complaints about the app seem valid.  Not that well designed, annoying pop ups, mysterious notifications.
4531	4	a	Usually good fun but often correct answers are wrong because of syntaxical errors. Also crashes continually when I open a game vs a specific player.
4532	5	a	Wow nice... I lovev it
4533	4	a	I am not Rambo. How can I kill all enemy by one person?! Yes you show many missions. But there are 3 missions were free. Graphic and control is excellent.
4534	4	a	Fun game, with challenging riddles. A few more rewards would be nice. The ads are quite annoying and the way things bop about on screen is also very annoying. I would like to see the ability to pass on a riddle so you can come back and solve it to finish a group to get the next reward.
4535	4	a	Really good app, would be perfect if it had a countdown to start instead of just a start button for timed runs, heres hoping?!
4536	5	a	I have all of them ex 5 love it get it

4540	4	a	" but it looks sleek"""
4541	2	a	Ugh, the graphics were bad, you cat turn the screen to were you like it, and make it more realistic.

4544	5	a	Awesome app! Haven't found anything even close.
4545	5	a	When you start flinging remains do you question the ethicality of he game. \u003d))) Great game.
4546	5	a	This game has challenges for all players of any skill, as well as a variety of bots. A great yet innactive multi-player community. Lastly this game is nothing like a pay to win (very balanced) and the creators have mentioned there desire for it to stay that way. Overall Highly recommended.
4547	1	a	Seems about right for DFX it does help audio but not when the app can't stay open long enough to play a song. LOL it will but can't touch any buttons while it's playing or it crashes every time! Also not that great on PC either not worth paying for yet that's for sure

4552	4	a	Simple \u0026 easy to use
4553	1	a	IT SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS and super boring
4554	5	a	Been using this for a long time, excellent app. Does what it should.
4555	1	a	Very bad game in the world
4556	3	a	I planned to buy this...but then you get timed. I was really hoping for a relaxed mode.
4557	3	a	It's a solid game for craps but they need to fix the betting mechanic. When you place a number, it's removed if it hits. I'd expect it to just stay there.
4558	4	a	Liked the app but I can't make in app purchases and I can't switch from dubstep
4559	2	a	It's OK but on the lite version you can only have one baby and the vernisher is already done for you so you can't decorate it how you like it. The money you get isn't enough to buy in the shop because the prices. I would give a rating out of 5 if it lowers the prices and be able to have more baby's. Thers a lot of beds in the kid room for only 1 baby. You have to pay to get the full version. I did like when I first got it but you couldn't decorate and sell and have more than one baby's lower the prices.
4560	2	a	I put it on automatic mode, but so far it never determines the speed limit right of the street I'm on. Meanwhile it keeps demanding I evaluate it, when I only used it for 5 minutes. How am I supposed to stop and do this now when I'm driving?
4561	5	a	I forget I have things to do with this game, great game, but I better put it down for now, things to do.
4562	3	a	nice wallpapers.. but unfortunately the tilting is not working.. might be some bug with the sensor..
4563	4	a	I like this game. This game has good images, sounds, and nice game play.
4564	3	a	I've enjoyed this game for a long time.  But now, for some reason, odd Google Play app screens pop up while I'm trying to play.
4565	3	a	the ads, man! I tried to pay the donation to remove them, but it would not open! What gives? If it's fixed, I give 5 stars. App does what's expected, but those ads cause problems!
4566	5	a	One of the best mini games.
4567	1	a	Don't bother downloading if I come across this again
4568	5	a	A strong sequel to the first book. It's substantially longer, and now your choices make an even bigger impact on the story. Definitely eager to read Part 3 now.
4569	2	a	Gets hung up. Doesn't know a chickadee. Needs work.
4570	1	a	I understand ads are needed, but ads suddenly start to play in full volume. And, now, in addition to those ads where you madly have to look for sound off icon, you decided to add more ads. This time they interfere with game play! Thanks. Uninstalling now
4571	5	a	Please increase range of fruits.... 💥
4572	5	a	I like it to play the music
4573	3	a	Is the lack of adjustment the photo end up with a crop odd crop, you can't select where to place the effect and the size of the effect, so most of them look odd not good also don't blend so good. Also some effects don't blend well bcuz they are too busy effects too much to apply so the add too much over a photo. So they could add less busy effects like few birds flying or some clouds moving so don't add too much busy layer over a photo to make it look more natural, but instead they look bad and unnatural
4574	2	a	Worked fine last year. No audio broadcast. Needs to be fixed.
4575	1	a	It wont move how do u make it drive
4576	5	a	Ok good you people get is its good oooooooooooo .........Get it its awesome :) O:-) :-P get it...
4577	1	a	It is rubbish I put my name and my (lovers)name but first it said 23% then 99% what don't play it it is terrible

4584	5	a	I love this game! ☺ its very fast paced, not good when stressed, but great fun! High difficulty rating but so far all levels are possible to reach perfect score. Awesome really! Give a try, its worth it... No ads. 😀
4585	3	a	It's a great Racer but it's let down by watching ads inbetween matches there is no multiplayer online that I see? As I say it's a well thought out physics w achievement on Google's play store but after a few day's it gets repetetive. Sorry hope to try later in year \u0026 review again 🤘☯🌟🌟🌟
4586	5	a	It's the best of over 200 chess clock apps i checked out. Jst one thing though, an icon to indicate who is black n who is white should be added to the time boxes. Really great app!
4587	5	a	A simple app and help me perfectly to do what I just need!
4588	4	a	LoLz it so much its has ghost rider my fav anti hero
4589	1	a	Ne radi, odbija aktivacijsku šifru i ruši se pri pokušaju unosa. Bio sam na šalteru dvaput, pojma nemaju. Slao sam mail službi za korisnike, obećali su popraviti u novoj verziji. Nakon nekoliko mjeseci, još uvijek nema nove inačice aplikacije. Očito ne misle to popraviti.
4590	5	a	خیلی کار آسان کرده ممنون
4591	1	a	Nothing in the app is usable.  You have to purchase everything as additional content, then it still doesn't work....beware
4592	5	a	My  kids learn more
4593	5	a	If only Robert Redford had this app in movie All Is Lost. Might have saved some grief. Would like sos standalone button as well.
4594	5	a	Its the best game ever
4595	2	a	controls are awkward, barely moves around. it's a mobile game, to make it better, use accelerometer to control the gun, and leave the touch screen for moving the helicopter.
4596	5	a	Extremely addictive game. You've got to get the animals on the platform no matter what     \u003e:( hehe very useful when you wanna get your mind off something else
4597	5	a	Back to 90s.  lovin it keep rocking
4598	5	a	Hello dude who ever made this make more of this game this is such a cool games I can't even say it
4599	2	a	As soon as I enable it, it crashes. Tried on OnePlus One with Android 6.0.
4600	5	a	It's better than other multiplayer game
4601	3	a	Well, this game is kinda disappointing, and mainly for this reason. This game has the ads WHILE your playing the game, and there at the bottom where your most likely to tap the screen when you trying to make the man jump! I'd suggest, for everyone else's sake, to just get the original version. It has less ads on it, and is more addictive and un than this one!
4602	1	a	It has reset my stats, I had the game finished except needed 1 star on the last 1, now it wants m to restart from stratch and deal with 1minute ads which I cannot skip.
4603	1	a	Its boring you cant control the buttons. You also cant even controll the buttons when you fall like when flow down your supposed take damage hate it!
4604	1	a	Absolutely hate the new version. You have removed option to search by \ncinema and see what is showing by day and time and then book. I gave \nfeedback during Beta testing on this multiple times so nice to see you \nignore feedback from users who use the app more than once a week and what \nyou now have are users wanting the item you ignored...good going Hoyts
4605	5	a	Good for galaxy note 10.1 and notepro 12.2
4606	4	a	My son loves these puzzles. We drive 30 minutes to daycare everyday and it keeps him entertained!
4607	4	a	This is so good, all the users of this game pls don't download this
4608	3	a	Be better if u had music or some kind if sound.
4609	1	a	I just installed this now and please dont install this. It will just root your phone without you being aware. My phone wasnt rooted and now after i installed this sht i just rooted automatically. And it has a bug also. It wont work believe me. If only i could give 0 i really would.
4610	4	a	It might not have been as long as I would have liked but I didn't feel cheated. The graphics are impressive. I felt challenged in all aspects of the game but not overly challenged and wanting to giveup. Last but certainly not least, NO GLITCHES!
4611	1	a	trebalo bi (0-)¤¤  :'(
4612	5	a	(I love it so much )
4613	4	a	I do not now what I wauld do without that game
4614	4	a	This game app is interesting, I just can not stop playing it, worth trying, thanks for the amazing work, developers.
4615	5	a	I won't stay on phone BUT HEY HO
4616	1	a	go keyboard has an app which allows u to use paid theme. how about for launcher and go sms?
4617	5	a	" though i cant move more than a few steps. Ive restarted my device and same issue."""
4618	5	a	Thaks u so much sir
4619	3	a	I seriously dont know whats wrong. It keeps saying theres a problem and it stopped correcting my work. I was really good but now its not even ok
4620	1	a	My old phone backed up all the messages to a file but my new phone isn't able to find the file
4621	2	a	Can't choose credssp encryption and can't connect to my pc anymore, which renders the app useless... So long and thanks for all the fish.
4622	1	a	uninstalling. tried to set up my information and it just says please wait....so much for this option
4623	5	a	I love the auto pencil marks. This is a nice clean sudoku application that is my favourite out of the many I have tried.
4624	1	a	It's called group sms plugin, but does really work? no. Have I installed all 10 plugins \u0026 had a group convo? no. am i happy with app? hmm, oh that's right NO.
4625	4	a	Best of the free apps. Be nice if it did not create custom fields when merge and if could choose primary record and merge image.
4626	5	a	Only got the basic version at the moment but even that goes a long way towards explaining the solar system in an interesting and informative way for me. Will update my review when I get round to purchasing the upgrade. So far I would recommend this as a good way to find stuff out about our home system. Looking forward to any updates...
4627	1	a	Uygulama kuponu okuturken birden kapanıyor. Kullanışlı değil
4628	2	a	Doesn't work on Nexus 6, 7.1.1
4629	2	a	This used to be my favorite video recording app. My recordings were always crystal clear and it allowed me to use my Bluetooth headset as a microphone. However I recently upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy S7 and now I am unable to record. It seems the video and audio are not synchronized. Apparently others with the S7 are having the same or similar issues. I hope anupdate is made so that I can once again continue using this app at which point I would rate it at a 5
4630	5	a	Would like to have landscape mode please
4631	5	a	Loved the launcher \u0026 themes
4632	5	a	Definitely the best app i have purchased for my daughter .. So helpful and the has so much fun
4633	1	a	This is one of the worst useless apps designed by the wanna be's price \nchopper. Please take your app off the market and fix your store experience. \n30 minutes in the chrckout line with unavailable self check-out kiosk's. \nReally triggering to see this app.
4634	1	a	So i installed the App but no widget or anything else is appearing so that for me this is completely useless. Maybe 5 stars if running appropriate
4635	5	a	terbaik,ya allah permudahknlah segale urusan untk mengerjekn umrah ini..aminn...
4636	5	a	My daughter  sneaks my phone!great app keep up good  work love it!hopefully  your apps are a hit!mostly my daughter  is 9 but she keeps getting F's.This is the best game  ever  been!I'm  in Canada and I'm  28
4637	5	a	Simple and does the job
4638	2	a	Generated barcodes are not read by terminals in some of shops represented, which renders the application dangerous to use and to leave the cards at home.
4639	5	a	I think if we could add other people thats not friends it coukd be better i dont have friends that want to play
4640	1	a	What is this i tried to log in and i put my e-mail and also my password but it won't let me log in i don't know why it keep saying my e-mail or password is wrong
4641	3	a	It a interest in game, but when you get to a certain level. You have to pay, to keep on playing. The cost of the game, is not worth getting the full version.
4642	4	a	It doesn't start with spring but the rest is good
4643	5	a	Good work. Best app to know about your sensors...
4644	4	a	some more settings? .. date format.. and maybe size.. ie lower numbers are off bottom slightly in moto 360..and time out :-)
4645	2	a	I love listening to KUOW on my android phone. The new iteration of the app's basic functionality is MUCH improved over the first one (even though it's ugly), but the app itself remains hugely annoying.   Quitting the App: There is no obvious way to close the app. Looked all around. Pressing the Back control twice exits, but leaves the app in memory. Can kill it in the Active apps widget, which is unsatisfactory. Launching the Task Manager (press \u0026 hold Home key) lets me X out but also does not completely remove it from memory. This is bad app manners, even if it just leaves a stub (and why would it be doing that?). Stupid. Sometimes the UI disappears from screen and Active Apps but keeps playing the datastream, and I have to force-stop it.
4646	1	a	I was trying to buy a gun it didn't work so I left and came back and lost all my skins
4647	5	a	It is awesome you should get this game
4648	5	a	I haven't played but I know I love it

4650	1	a	Can't control the limo it sucks
4651	3	a	Even though you close the triangles, sometimes you don't get them...
4652	4	a	I liked it this game..Try it many people
4653	1	a	Theres no more sound in it and there are no different attacks or lighting in Super Saiyans 2 and 3
4654	3	a	I love this app,  it's a great way to keep track of goals and gives you the kick in the pants you need to get going.  One glitch though,  one goal is complete but I still got reminders for it even though I have moved it to history.  I managed to fix that by turning off the alarm but this should be automatic once a goal is reached.  Fix that and I'll give 5 stars.
4655	4	a	I can't change the time from military time.
4656	5	a	I've been using the Plus version for three years, and I have no complaints. Enough customization to change things up once in a while.
4657	5	a	I loved it so much. I liked everything about this game.
4658	2	a	The PC version (or internet version rather) is amazing and I have been playing it since 2012, decided to try this out and was sadly a bit disappointed, three or more fingers doesn't work well and sometimes when I'm moving my fingers fast It can't keep up, which is annoying if I'm playing an upbeat rock hit that I love.  I won't request a refund though, because your internet app is amazing and you deserve the support. Keep up the good stuff
4659	3	a	I can't play bottom row..ads are on the way...
4660	3	a	Thought we could schedule an appt through app. Wanted to see when the stylist was there and schedule accordingly.
4661	5	a	Nice game its really fun nice job guys hope u make more
4662	1	a	Offered me $70 for a college engineering book that I bought for $200. Serious crooks
4663	5	a	I  love this app easy to use also I'm not very good when it comes to  all  these electronics, and I found this very easy all my friends love it when I use their picture and send them back a picture with a frame or video. Thank you
4664	5	a	It is an excellent game loved it
4665	5	a	Drift feels good. Also fun that it takes some practice but once you get it its definitely worth it!
4666	5	a	I love all the waterfalls if you could add more of them it's a small choice \nI appreciate that thank you so much
4667	4	a	I just passed the permit yesterday. There were definitely many questions on there that I learned from using this app! Highly recommend. I liked that it also has the manual you can read and organized into different parts. If you use this app in combination with some online practice quizzes, you'll pass.
4668	5	a	I want to say that it's a great app so INSTALL IT IN UR PHN... thank😊😊
4669	5	a	Чудесная игра, полезная для мозгов. Все отлично работает
4670	3	a	Join so that you can enjoy.
4671	5	a	Is going as well as the other ones
4672	5	a	Excellent candy game that made me crave candy so bad lol. Had fun matching and swiping the candy.
4673	5	a	From simple Thai salad to complex flavours of Thai curry, this app has got numerous Thai dishes for you.
4674	5	a	The game are great i enjoy it much but why there is some items i didnt use and if they are for something why you make the game can continue without using all items and clues ... and also the game is a little short dont you think !! i hope it continue soon and make it a little challanging Otherwise its great Update :  Thank you for your fast reply and i think its real amusing that why i feel it short cuz i couldnt stop until the game finish 5 star  for fast replying and caring
4675	5	a	Sana ibahin ang mga jokes kahit every 2 month
4676	2	a	Without any doubt this is the slowest app on my phone hands down. Standard \nbrowser 100% faster and more content. App needs serious improvement. I've \nused the app on and off for a couple years now and its always been the \nsame. I expect a lot more out of Cabelas, this is truly disappointing.
4677	4	a	Absolutely incredible game best i ever l play so far. But i can only play the first episode of season two.and in order to play second episode i have to purchase and its so expensive 34000 some are even more... what is it because i didn't play the season one? Hope maker of the game will answer me. I really wanna wanna play this amazing game. So plzz help me what to do
4678	3	a	Not very well made but still rather enjoyable. Could do away with the auto switching of players and replace it with a button that allows manual switch instead. Movements were rather smooth and easy to control at times apart from slight glitches here and there.
4679	2	a	When I played half of her face was black. Don't play this
4680	1	a	مزخرف تر از این ندیده بودم دان نکنید
4681	5	a	I must say that this game is absolutely perfect from graphic interface to music background, really excited to me. In game play, we must handle my phone into visual bliss in many states. This is really an intelligent game requiring my our reflexion  and skills. However, i can't exit game with my back button, hope you will fix it soon, my device is samsung galaxy s2.
4682	4	a	It is good for school children
4683	5	a	Is a amazing application 😊
4684	1	a	Uninstalled after the first game
4685	5	a	Works on samsung spica. Prevents 'leakage' of 3g bytes when phone is idling in wifi mode.
4686	3	a	Bad graphics and no gear selection
4687	5	a	Chicken Hunter Classic, good hunting game
4688	1	a	Complete rubbish. This game is un playable despite several steering modes.
4689	4	a	Nice and easy to use app.
4690	5	a	ممتاز ولكنه كثير التوقف يرجى اصلاح الاعطال
4691	1	a	Installed but not getting opened.PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS..
4692	2	a	Cards move too slow.  Cards are too small. Screen shifts if you dont hit the card exaclty which gets annoying

4695	4	a	not bad.... i really can use this app. thank you.
4696	3	a	Send  me one of them,all nice.
4697	5	a	I love the wall camera!!! Also that I can have a prayer put in the wall!!!
4698	5	a	Very simple, yet effective. I've tried almost all of the other tinnitus apps, and removed them.  This app is all I need for instant relief.

4700	2	a	The wording is too much smallest to read especially in smartphone now

4707	5	a	This app is paid on ios but play store. Is free i love android
4708	1	a	When you type in a word, it's either not on the list and you can send it for a suggestion or you find a word that it accepts that isn't on the list so it doesn't count. Its a complete waste of time and space in your phone.
4709	5	a	i love it so much!
4710	4	a	Good design. However, when I find an app that works well \u0026 has a pay \nversion, I like to reward the developer by purchasing the pro/ad-free \noption. $2.50 is too much for an egg timer. I've spent less on far more \nuseful and versatile applications.
4711	5	a	Easy to setup. Allows me to run credit card transactions on the road on my laptop.
4712	2	a	i like it but sometimes when i try to combine two 2s it doesn't move but if i combine some other numbers it works fix this and and u'll  get 5 stars
4713	3	a	I'm just not really into it. Getting story would be great for this concept, but it's not there, and getting farther doesn't seem like much of a thing. Also, there's no sense of progression. Sure, I get somewhat better each time, but I can't buy anything with the things I've earned because all of it is extremely expensive, and there's no information about the things in the store, so I have no idea if buying them from playing long enough to actually manage to buy anything will even be worth it.
4714	2	a	Great concept but the game at some points are too hard why would you make a game that stresses people out. fun and exciting not stressful!!!!! You should make the ship take hits collect damage over time healing items much more fun this way keeps you coming back for more I hope you fix this game it could actually be something great.
4715	1	a	"There is no such \Google Checkout\"" option. It only gives me the Getjar option and there is no way I'm using that option. So what's the deal?  Rating 1 because I'm unable to use it until the issue is resolved."""
4716	1	a	Can only hear a constant rumbling sound. Does not pick up anything from mic even if I talk into it. I have an S3. Didn't work for me unfortunately.

4720	1	a	This app not good these day.. stuck on Authentication..i tried more but not able to open..
4721	2	a	It works... But just barely. It records while you take notes but after you start a recording you can't type in the more without recording at the same time. So if you want to go back and edit a note you have to start recording again. Also no option to copy and paste. Basically just need to be a bit more feature rich and user friendly.
4722	5	a	Really easy to use, would suggest for everyone! Like like!!!
4723	5	a	It makes recording of my sons daily activity so much easier.  Highly recommended.
4724	5	a	This is the best app to find out the Qibla. I've tried many other apps but you won't be disappointed with this one Highly recommended.
4725	4	a	It took more than a month, but they responded
4726	1	a	Find it would show a page with apps then it will take me back to the home screen plz fix this

4732	2	a	Nice forecast and interface, but unusable tiny unresizeable widgets make all the hard work in vain.
4733	5	a	The game is Awsome but theres a slight bug I found...I dont know if its only me but....I noticed every single time I pickup the slow mode thing and if I pause and then continue ,it glitches...its like I dont even have it but it still shows the time line of the time slow thing and if u pickup another slow time but the bugged one didnt ware off...it wont slow time ...And 1 more thing....the game is good and all but...it took me 3h to get to the last ship...it would be more awsome if u actuly added levels
4734	5	a	I am very satisfied having downloaded this app since it contains every \nrelevant setting round about egg cooking. It helps me getting my breakfast \nstraight and is very easy to handle. The ads are not too disruptive, so the \nfree version is great, but I am sure the pro one pays off too
4735	3	a	متاسفانه مناسبتها را به طور کامل نداره . مثلا این هفته ۱۲ اردیبهشت تعطیل \nاست ولی نشان نمیده

4740	4	a	Bastante util, solo que para agregar o modificar transferencias y pagos tienes que ir a la aplicacion en desktop
4741	4	a	It's Very Fun. But When I Play It Sometimes Does This Glitch Where The Other Team Keeps Scoring And They Dont. So No 5 Stars
4742	5	a	This app is highly informative and educative I recommend this app for everyone Thanks for the good work
4743	3	a	My 3 days trial just got over so can you please provide me free access to \nyour app for only 2 days
4744	3	a	Too primitive.  Good graphics, but need to be able to have multiple players to invite, and choice of timed or not timed.....and choice of categories.....

4758	2	a	It downloads all the way and gets stuck on 100. Its stupid dddddddddd.
4759	2	a	i hate all the games that it like each other you no i like the game inside it you found a many games like that a girl in her house cooking and make a spa and makeup and dressup and she goes to a supermarket and cleaning her house like that
4760	5	a	Laughed, cried,  and cringed when I had to make those decisions I didn't want to. Always difficult.. Prolly had a mantra of apologies going on in the background during that run, but the cuteness was worth it. I enjoyed this story quite a bit and adored watch these characters interact as the story unfolded. So short, but oh how sweet it was.
4761	2	a	Lipsesc cuvinte din baza cu duiumul...baza pusă la dispoziţie de cei de la dex este destul de completă, prin urmare cred ca este o eroare de dezvoltare.Interfaţa cam lasă de dorit...mult prea banală şi distanta....

4764	1	a	Horrible didn't even get to play
4765	3	a	Nice that it has no ads, but it has stopped working for me
4766	1	a	This thing is better at getting numbers wrong than right. I'm better off blindly throwing chips down than using this app.
4767	1	a	Slow to load pictures. Fonts are tiny, hard to read. When scroll to other site,  it is too fast. Photo quality are not that good. Place of interest is limited.
4768	5	a	Foarte bine optimizată. Superioară celei de la Vocea care mai dă rateuri.

4772	1	a	L HATE THAT U NEED TO BUY THE LAST 3 LANDS IF U MAKE THEM FREE UR GAMES WILL STILL SURVIVE SO MAKE ALL OF UR GAMES FREE SO UR COMPANY WILL STILL SURVIVE
4773	5	a	I love this game but there is only one thing I would love. If there was a slime diary so you have a diary of all the slimes you have encountered gets put in your diary and a little bit of information about this slim e.g. the red slime gets very angry at times and is found in the slime underworld. You probably won't do this but I really would like this to be a new feature!
4774	5	a	Perfect replacement for my paper sliding graders!
4775	5	a	The game is fun, you can make some great friends too. Some immature horny little kids might make you feel uncomfortable but you can just ban them or go to a new server, I' have so much fun making my worlds. My name on the game is SavagePumpkin, come play with me.
4776	4	a	" and neither are my achievements. Very frustrating."""
4777	1	a	I really enjoyed playing this game and with the most recent update has put a banner ads on the top of the screen for the first minute of each round. That's not the real problem because I understand this is the free version. The problem is the banner covers live parts of the map so your planes can crash off while they are under the banner with you having no clue and no way to stop it. I'd give negative stars if I could because it is actually not playable anymore.
4778	1	a	I  love  this
4779	4	a	The account statement which is being generated and sent to email has \nrepeated entries. Try to fix it

4789	5	a	Dude this game is amazing, if you don't install this you need a reason why.
4790	1	a	Mwhen my kid played this game he looked at me and said : this game is terrible! I was surprised when he said that! He usually likes simple games!
4791	5	a	I don't even like fish, but this wallpaper is awesome!!!  I could watch it for ages!!!!  And I love that it is interactive! ! :)   my only suggest is that it would be cool to have baby turtles...  I like turtles :)
4792	2	a	There is not an easy way to stop this game.
4793	5	a	I enjoy this app. But please fix how it always goes back to the start. Also same with trying to make a comment when u hav to use the keybd.
4794	5	a	Love every bit of it...it's bright and colourful, has everything I would need/ want in a dictionary 💜
4795	1	a	Old version used to work alright on older version of Android. Now it crashes right away when it's enabled.
4796	1	a	How does a hole in one not score enough points to get to the next level. Too difficult to win as the controls are also too sensitive its a stupid guessing game.

4803	4	a	This app has wonderful walpapers but i wish the app didnt crash every so often and reset my wallpaper.
4804	1	a	Game is unplayable beyond level 2! I just wasted $ on this junk, don't be fooled into doing the same! This really sucks because the 1st two levels were nice, then you hit a brick wall, no way to proceed. Maybe this will be fixed, until then the game should be free as It's only a demo. UPDATE: tested on 2 seperate Samsung devices (Tab 3 \u0026 Note 4), same glitch in both. Avoid this game If you use Samsung devices. Still no reply from the designer,  VERY disappointed...
4805	5	a	I subscribe to this magazine \u0026 have for over 10yrs \u0026 counting! I'm in the film industry \u0026 this magazine provides all the info you'll need in all in one place. Wether a filmmaker or horror fan you'll be glad to own this app \u0026 better yet make certain that you subscribe to the magazine as their all very valuable collectors items.

4811	3	a	Hi I had to reinstall the game after I brought some gold and now I haven't got it please sort it out I want my money back
4812	4	a	Annoying with constant rating reminders that's why 4 and not 5
4813	4	a	Over all a very decent game. Most games that appear like this have a bunch of stupid quarks that ruin the game, such as ads and in-game purchases; it's always something. This game has no such quarks. It plays exactly how it looks. Thumbs up
4814	5	a	game freezes before the player/device won screen
4815	4	a	I'm grateful for finding this app and reading the many great Buddhist quotes. The collection seems to be enormous with quotes from Thich Nhat Hand,  Alan Watts and of course Buddha himself. If I could improve the app, then I would make an option to return to the quotes that I have favourited. I would also improve the widget, so it updates the quotes following the interval I have chosen, right now it seems to update the quote every time I return to the widget, which is a bit too much for me.
4816	5	a	Love it, very fast and secure.
4817	4	a	I think that the faces should change as you go from sober to wasted. That small difference would be very entertaining. Over all very fun game . I like the details

4822	5	a	Top app for top research
4823	5	a	Couldn't get past the Terms and Conditions. Went into my phone settings and changed permissions and now It's working fine.
4824	5	a	I luv it so cool wallpapers
4825	4	a	The game is good ex for the adds but the prising on the stuff is allot ex for that and the addas the game is good
4826	5	a	Any chance for a 12 hour clock instead of 24 hour?
4827	4	a	Ok, I guess. Only one thats free. It gets the job done.

4832	4	a	I will try if the play is good.......but I will give 4 stars. For it bcoz you have made it for the people.
4833	1	a	I think it is the worst game in the world . It's my humble request to all \nthat don't download this it's full of time waste 😭
4834	4	a	Its very good. Great job
4835	4	a	Well, when attacking some of the french I found that it is not good to watch TV at the same time, either you must have the ability to see round corners or monty python will start and a silly French man will verbally abuse you
4836	1	a	When I type in my password, it only uses caps lock instead lowercase. Good thing I have my Google keyboard on.
4837	5	a	Five stars. Love how it gives you money for the scratch off game. Only downfall it seems a little laggy with the bird. But besides that I adore both games

4841	3	a	Updated review: sound now works again. 5 stars. Great game, good port. It works, but the sfx and voice sounds no longer work since Android Oreo (on Razer Phone). Would be five stars otherwise, but it looks like 2K aren't interested in updating it.
4842	5	a	OMG I FAWND THE GAME YES I HAVEN'T PLAYD IN SSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOO LONG
4843	5	a	Unfortunately my phone isn't rooted. Which I missed the requirement that one must have root permission. Yet Proxy+ appears to be working fine on my phone (Android 4.4.2). I use FF Beta \u0026 checked 3 websites to see what my IP Address was \u0026 all said my address was in a completely different part of the country. If possible in future updates could you please make your app work on non-rooted phones?
4844	3	a	The app works really well as long as you don't expect a lot from it. It literally does what it says it does. It cuts images. It perfectly crops faces trees flowers scenery anything with a solid border, from an image. You then have to save it and use another app to place it on another image. But it's a lot better than a lot of those other cropping apps. This 1 traces perfectly around the borders. It's almost like the lasso tool from Photoshop.
4845	2	a	I have a downward facing strategy and my game. Even when I'm not touching my phone, my game swipes up, I've gone as far as the 2 tile, I was a few moves from finishing the whole game, And my game swiped up, and I lost within seconds
4846	5	a	It works perfectly and also doesn't take up so much space in my phone storage. The filters are great and the features are very easy to use. Good job!
4847	5	a	ad chi minh xin code di
4848	3	a	Doesn’t play all videos I get. An example is a video I just received on particle news would not play and I have no idea how to let you know what format it might be. Can you tell me how I can identify the format of a video? I can usually find the format on my PC but on my phone it's a different story
4849	4	a	On Galaxy S8 running android 7.0 the non-physical home button unlocks the phone. I did not have this problem with my S6 running 4.2.  Five stars otherwise.
4850	1	a	Super slow!!! Freezed and D/C all the time! Uninstalled.
4851	5	a	This is one of those games that just sucks you in. Great gameplay mechanics, awesome environment, and incredible replay value. I'm on my third playthrough and it never gets old. If you like RTS games, give this one a try. Try auralux too, its a little more simplistic, but more frenetic.
4852	1	a	I had high hopes for this browser. But unfortunately i was disappointed \nwith it. It crashes, flash pages don't work correctly. I have been trying \nto get a refund for sometime now because google and the app developers have \nmade it difficult to get the refund back for such a failed (wannabe) Firfox \nknock off imitation browser. My honost advice is to support and donate to \nreal products. So, my question is where is my refund Google!!
4853	2	a	Game is very buggy shuts down in the middle of the game. Have reported the problem several times.  it is pretty fun when it is working
4854	1	a	This app is horrible I downloaded it and it wouldn't work.. Then I uninstalled it and it wouldn't work..
4855	4	a	Would be 5 stars if it didn't go blank when I hit the home button sometimes. Otherwise, its amazing!
4856	3	a	Really fun and addictive game, but it tends to freeze and crash a lot. Fix that and I'll add stars
4857	5	a	It stink. I hate eet.
4858	5	a	This game is simple to start but hard to accomplish. you should have a high IQ to deal with all the SODUKU it has. Recommend to you all.
4859	2	a	My saves always crash when I try to load them. Using a Sony Xperia Z1s, stock ROM, rooted and bootloader unlocked, overclocked, on 4.3. My SD is a high-rated Samsung Evo 32GB. Also, please support Moga (specifically Pocket) a bit better, some games aren't mapped very well
4860	3	a	Frequent lock ups on ads and power-up screens, kind of disappointing.
4861	1	a	I just downloaded this app to see if I could recommend it to my students. It doesn't even let me log in with my mygoethe id. It's completely unusable at this point on both my android phone and ipad.
4862	1	a	Really a game like this and you can not save your progress. It's ridiculous to charge someone for a game that can not be save!!! Get it together!!!!
4863	5	a	I dont like very many games
4864	1	a	After the update, all the stores are closed!
4865	5	a	This game is just amazing,good graphic and themes,good job
4866	1	a	Nothing is showing. How am I ment to pass my driving if u can't see it. Wouldn't even get it!
4867	5	a	Great game I just don't like that you have to pay for the last two islands
4868	5	a	No ads... Does what says... Im sold
4869	5	a	I really live this game.  I love how challenging the missions are and how you can choose between part A and B of the game because this is probably just a two part type game of the full version.
4870	5	a	This app seems great. The fact it has numbers for other help such as crime stoppers and poison hotline and the line for people who are deaf or speech impaired is fantastic. The only thing I would suggest is a line such as access line, or beyondblue as such lines have proved very life saving for my family including getting someone into the ambulance at a critical time. I have one question that for obvious reasons I don't want to try but the numbers attached in this app do they register and begin a phone call when pressed?
4871	1	a	Why is all or games not free?? Well u should make a free one winter wolves!!
4872	4	a	Add at least one new character for free. The same two gets boring after a while. And just an idea because I thought it'd be cool, add something like a grab button, so u can grab \u0026 hang on to things. Just and idea for fun

4877	5	a	If you are scared of mice, I recommend this app. The soothing tones resonate with my rodent phobias and have made me a better person who gets kept in the garage
4878	5	a	Super cool app my sister got scared she almost started crying it flashes and everything
4879	2	a	Can't see predictions for the next 14 days without paying. UI looks like it was designed in the 90's and does not follow Android guidelines. Probably the worst looking app on my phone so the predictions better be accurate.
4880	5	a	It deserves more stars .Believe me, Most efficient and smart amoung free apps.
4881	3	a	Best remote app. Search is somewhat confusing.

4886	3	a	Salam. How are you? Sir your app is very good but you need to fix issue. First urdu option cannot run the app next fase and screen blink after a second.

4890	4	a	Such a nice app, i've been using it for a years for now.. i hit 5 stars for this, great job,
4891	5	a	Just does the job! :)
4892	4	a	Great game. Good controls. A little frustrating, no jackpot hit yet...
4893	2	a	I have used many sony products. I feel quality of products going down. Sbh50. Its buggy. Audio drop is huge problem. Calls are not clear. Button goes non responsive. Radio reception and audio quality is poor. Multipoint is additional confusion for  sbh50 itself. Previous MW600 was awesome. Where as this one is mare waste.
4894	5	a	Eccellente app, molto utile! Mille grazie allo sviluppatore che deve anche essere un ottimo cuoco ;)
4895	4	a	i would love to have principle only options too. Otherwise Five from me for sure. Also why not available for IOS users. Could not find you guys in apps store.
4896	4	a	I love this game, but it's impossible to get 3 stars on the memory portion as the rules only flip so fast.  It's disappointing. 😕
4897	1	a	Purchased the membership and within 24 hours canceled and emailed customer \nsupport to receive a refund a few days after and asked for a pro rate back. \nWas met with push back.
4898	5	a	Decided to give this a shot the other day, and it worked perfectly. Fell asleep right around the countdown ending, and realized I was awake when the wake up countdown hit 6... I highly recommend this!
4899	2	a	Would freeze and stop working every time I tried doing anything with it. :( I really wanted to have this app but it just won't work so I'll have to uninstall unfortunately

4903	2	a	It's like cookie clicker but needs a few tweaks. Music, less annoying noises when getting coins, a bigger blocks, and more variety.
4904	5	a	I love it bc I love pets and its a good way for someone to get used to a pet
4905	2	a	Cant read the text in the type box in the pop up because of the color of the  font
4906	3	a	Change the app name for the phones manager. Make it more discrete.  Also make it so MMS shows up hidden too.  I'd give it a 5 then.
4907	2	a	I guess I'm missing the point. The apps you're promoting are the free versions of the paid ones, with no indication how to get those for free. If you want to run a recommendation service, do that. Don't misrepresent a trial version as a gift when it's not.
4908	4	a	It teach u a lot about ice fishing
4909	5	a	It's the only poker app I've ever played that doesn't show the losing \nplayers all in hands which to me isn't really poker. On a positive note \nthere are more bingo players on poker king then I've seen on any other app
4910	1	a	" thereafter no results again it redirests to play \nstore. However the app is up to date. Worst situation."""
4911	1	a	Does not work at all poor!!!!!
4912	3	a	Some of the mods don't work and there hasn't been any new mods I'm getting bored of this app
4913	1	a	Will not let me click on hidden object. Fix please
4914	1	a	It says this app require root access but root can not found smthing.....then close i dont know how to work up.
4915	1	a	Latest update no longer works.
4916	5	a	All these in the world  I AM MOVING MOUNTAINS
4917	5	a	Had a problem not getting boot liquor station they resolved it right away
4918	4	a	Can't figure out how to unlock new skills, with no rhyme or reason to how they unlock. Haven't experienced any crashes as of yet. Overall, great game, very simple controls, nice challenge, and a semi-serious, witty atmosphere.
4919	5	a	Does what it says on the tin. Couple of people haven't realised it's a widget so leave bad reviews, need to learn how to use their phones.
4920	4	a	App works great but your video and pictures are way outdated in the play store.  Ideas. Is there anyway to mirror the poweramp playlist. I have gigs of music and cannot scroll through all of them. Is this possible on android wear?
4921	3	a	Looks promising to offer south Sudanese timely news updates,,
4922	1	a	This game cheats like crazy!!! It will hit your ship instantly when you hit one of its ships
4923	1	a	I can't update any news after 31 Dec 2016
4924	1	a	Anything you type including passwords and credit card info can be recorded by the app. Definitely not a good idea to use it! It also has ads above the keyboard which got me very annoyed.
4925	5	a	Perfect application, my device is rooted and the remote + An2An touch is working beautifully. 5 stars.
4926	5	a	I like free stuff too.
4927	2	a	The idea behind this app is exactly what I was looking for to integrate with Tasker so I was excited to try it out.  Adding an event is extremely easy, especially integrate with Google voice. However, the ads are ridiculous. I tried for a minute straight in the settings to just change the input method, which is a single click, and couldn't because of the constant full page ads popping up.  I'm giving two stars for now, just because it is a good idea and simple to use.  Fix the ads and I'll gladly give five
4928	3	a	Its ok. But it's really hard to control. And it would be better if there \nwas a flying option
4929	5	a	Collect cards totaling 7 and half to win.
4930	3	a	I have been using this app and trying to download a couple  free giveaways of the day. Where do I get the access code to get rid of the ads? I can't seem to get the pro version of any of these. I have been following your website for years. I thought this app would be as good as that is. Only three stars so far and that's only because I like you guys.
4931	5	a	Loved this wallpaper app, but its now broken on Xperia Z after kitkat update
4932	5	a	It had been a good app before, but the last update completely broke the displaying of all images. Happy to give more stars once this has been sorted. Edited as promised.
4933	5	a	I was finding such a economics book on play store you made it easy I really thankful to you
4934	3	a	Cek lagi huruf2 arabnya terutama quran, semisal di albaqoroh 3 ayat terakhir, mayasya pakai tsa diquran cetak pakai sya, saya lihat yg di sugronya juga sama, tetap semangat berbuat kebaikan
4935	5	a	I download this about 3 or 4 years ago and now I have my dream house
4936	2	a	Dev has been stellar. However lately since the change to no ads the rdp connection frequently stops responding. I've tested with other devices and PC's. This is not a rdp / network issue. I've reinstalled this app and it still does not work.
4937	5	a	بارك الله فيك يا شيخنا الجليل ونفع بك الامة
4938	2	a	I like it but to childish
4939	1	a	I actually adore this game. But since the last update it keeps error \nmessaging me and closing on the start up menu. I have sent two separate \nfeedbacks and uninstalled /reinstalled twice and nothing is working.
4940	5	a	This looks really good on my phone
4941	3	a	"Its ok. Dont use it often. Only doing this to stop the \write a review pop up\""."""
4942	1	a	I hate it so much don't get it
4943	5	a	I belive in God I like it ..it is also useful for my kids to learn
4944	1	a	Couldn't find it in my apps wasn't there
4945	1	a	I think this app is either broke of it is being used to get people to download and install lookout. It reports my device as vulnerable. I've been asking T-Mobile when that were going to fix it. It so happens that the fix was pushed two months. This piece of crap software continues to report vulnerable and has caused undue stress by tricking me into thinking I was vulnerable when I was not.  Good thing that I don't need it any more but causes me to question the accuracy of Lookout's other apps.
4946	5	a	I'm not sure what folks are talking about but this just works great.  I purchased a training course that was made up of about 20 hours of video and a 250'ish page PDF of course material.  Everything was accessible instantly on my phone in addition to through the Gumroad webpage.  The video streaming is great looking quality wise.    If I had one critique it would be really nice to send the video to my chromecast directly in the app, but I just used the screen casting option on my phone and that worked fine.
4947	5	a	The app plays high quality ghaxals and has a good selection of best ghazals of top artiste
4948	5	a	addictive and fun for all skill levels. You can select from 3 difficulty levels. Very nicely designed game with no permissions. Well worth the small price paid for the app.
4949	4	a	In Add on section the Premium add on is mentioned as Daily Basic and it offers 80MB+10MB Free total 90MB Not 20MB free.pls correct it.
4950	5	a	This is a great app for FMGEEs
4951	5	a	Jdos hockshops the 91 time f3 🆒 or 9 a.m. 51 percent from you have 👹
4952	5	a	I like the sms pro. I've tried other message apps, but i always come back to this app. So many beautiful themes and many to chose from.
4953	5	a	Vivat the Developer! So simple should be a file handler.
4954	1	a	Worked fine with my old phone but keeps telling me now that my email address is invalid. Uninstalling it.
4955	5	a	Good app for my mobile
4956	3	a	It is a cute dinosaur who runs fast.
4957	3	a	This is an easy to use app, but there is no chime or alarm that sounds when the time runs out.  That's a pretty big deal!  If the developer adds that this is an awesome app.
4958	2	a	Last version is gud but this one waste
4959	1	a	Why only swedish? Add more other languages like English 😡😤
4960	2	a	Η διαφήμιση κρύβει όλο το κάτω μέρος και δεν βλέπουμε την τελευταία ημέρα... στοιχειώδης λεπτομέρεια την οποία αγνοούν..

And if I'm not doing anything wrong, FIX IT PLEASE!!! I REALLY want to like this game but until I know what is going on, IM NOT GOING TO GIVE THIS FIVE STARS!!!! So *PLEASE* reply!! I'm begging you!
4962	2	a	Pretty average. Come on RNZ. Build a better app.
4963	1	a	after completing level 400 this app just get crashed. please fix the problem.then i will give 5 star
4964	5	a	Allah ap ko ezat dy
4965	1	a	Doesn't even give me the option of open... just uninstall
4966	3	a	Despite having purchased the full version it still cuts me off mid session and tells me to purchase the full version. Fail. Would be 5 star if not for retarded ass error.
4967	3	a	Meh. It's okay. Big downfall is that you pretty much have to log in through Facebook to play properly (at least that's what it seems like so far). I'm not really understanding how the whole leveling up works out. There doesn't appear to be any stats you can change or, anything like that. Overall, it is alright, but most likely not a keeper since, there isn't really any interactive game play.
4968	5	a	Sweet and Simple.. Less memory consumption.. I would make it a 5 star if a equalizer would be made up in next update and an search option..
4969	4	a	Still seems to miss inviting some people despite phone numbers being used. Also not the best viewing on mobile devices (adequate but not great).
4970	5	a	Very useful app for beginners who is trying to learn Cantonese. I hope you will keep adding new vocabulary words in future
4971	1	a	i would like a refund
4972	1	a	Ridiculous makes no sense at all
4973	5	a	All you need to know to be out of the side line and in to the Dance floor.. \nAs well very good tool to teach new move to others as instructor level..
4974	4	a	Website is amazing. App is good except that it freezes when I open links from browser.
4975	5	a	I love it because its made by  SSundee \u0026 the rest of Team Crafted,its a hybrid of temple run and flappy bird without being rage-inducing, plus I love the hats you can buy. The only thing wrong is the hats are expensive. Other than that awesome game.
4976	5	a	I found the wallpapers to be peaceful and relaxing
4977	1	a	Add more drumkits like the virtual drum in pc.
4978	1	a	Fake app hai nhi hote
4979	5	a	Giving 5 stars cuz not tried yet......yaar ye itna mar mar ke kyu load ho rha hai??  :-!
4980	5	a	Some clues not so good but really enjoy playing
4981	1	a	Worst app ever I'm a scarcely cat and I'm STILL not scared of these \nringtones BIIIIIIG LEATDOWN
4982	1	a	Never works after 10pm. It completely ignores your typing on the password input screen, so you can't login at all at those times. EDIT: It didn't work because of using a screen overlay app (Twilight). Still, it's awful that input is disabled without showing a popup and saying it.
4983	1	a	Not able to fetch files :(
4984	5	a	Excellent! I can still remember how tedious getting this effect on film was, so finding this app and finding that it works very well on my phone(lg optimus g prime) has been great.!
4985	5	a	من واقعا به خواندنای هندی علاقه دارم اما هر قدر کوشش میکنم دانلود نمیشه لطفا مشکل منو حل کنید لطفا
4986	2	a	Doesn't work a lot of the time and constantly getting warnings from my phone that it's eating my battery. Works great when it works.
4987	3	a	I didn't get my FREE COINS !
4988	5	a	A great 3d property application.
4989	4	a	It's a nice game but there are a lot of force close problems
4990	4	a	Ok so first there is this weird coloring everytime I play, like strange lights that block out about half the screen and cant see through. And second it keeps force closing for no reason. Can you guys please fix this problem.
4991	5	a	Love everything about it.   The theme down to the sounds.
4992	5	a	Love the uncomplicated ones. Needed a reminder of all things to pack in motorhome. Perfect! Would have liked a save feature so I could have multiple lists. Needed one for outstanding DIYjobs, but would need to wipe motorhome list which I am reluctant to do. Will look for an alternative app which is a shame as I really rate this one!
4993	3	a	Bad graphics, won't let me load length 512 and height 512
4994	3	a	Скачет очень сильно вверх и вниз. Масштаб и выравнивание никак не влияют. Очень надеюсь что проьлема временная.
4995	5	a	Everything is perfect regarding the story and the Characters are amazingly likable which makes its difficult to find a favourite. Any stupid person who gave this any lower then 4 stars deserves to die.
4996	3	a	Lots of useful info. Hopefully soon we can see/edit cron jobs, email accts, etc. Right now only can delete or create new. It should have option for password on start of app. Keep up the good work
4997	1	a	Easily one if the most stupid game I've ever played. Whether it was the unclear instructions or the annoying, ear piercing head throbbing music, this game got Uninstaller well after the first game.
4998	1	a	i hate this s game the bouts olws i cant ieat them 😡
4999	4	a	It's fun no matter how old u r, its great for everyone 😄
5000	2	a	I think you have to do something about the interface I mean, when choosing \na building it's hard to click those small arrow heads... fix it.
5001	4	a	Very good. Nice GUI. Does it all. Definately needs a way to customize the defalt conversion value lists. Fix it and its a 5-star app.
5002	4	a	I love that I can control everything for recording video. I plan on using this app for filmmaking and I noticed that I can't change the aspect ratio, if I could film in anamorphic that would be amazing. Also I noticed that I can't adjust the frame rate. My phone can do 60fps on 1080p but I am forced to shoot in 30fps. Also if you could add 24fps, that would be superb. It's the frame rate that films use
5003	5	a	כלי מצויין ומועיל. מזגזג בשבילך בתפריטים המעצבנים. מומלץ בחום
5004	3	a	Its kk kk type nt tht gud acc. to me
5005	1	a	Only hit the ball and nothing else
5006	4	a	Its awesome to shoot all the flappy birds (maniacal laugh) .... I'm not crazy
5007	1	a	8 million minutes before i regain 1 life then when i reinstalled it i lost all my data. So very stupid

5010	5	a	I've completed this game 3 times on N64 and twice on DS and not once was i able to get 100%. Using this guide as a help I'll be able to get 100% this time. Thank you.
5011	5	a	This theme is awsome !
5012	5	a	i have a love hate with this game, i love it because it is so fun and cute, and i hate because it is so fun and cute, the puzzles are beyond what others say they can finish in a couple of hours. those that say that, have one of two things, but we'll not go into that. 2D Boy, great game, keep it up, and don't forget, people on here want updates asap. so if your game is liked by many, and i'm one of em, you need to keep us updated on what you are doing... please.\\
5013	5	a	Nod bad... Time pass game

5017	3	a	Die App ist grundsätzlich gut gemacht und erfüllt hinsichtlich der Aussprache der Buchstaben die Bedürfnisse von Kindern die das Lesen lernen.  Leider ist die App nicht multiuserfähig. Auf dem eingeschränktem Account für meine Tochter (auf einem Nexus 10) startet sie nicht.  Der Kauf der Vollversion (InApp-Kauf) gilt nicht für Familienmitglieder (Stichwort Familienbibliothek). Meine Frau müsste also nochmal 4,99 € ausgeben. Das ist etwas enttäuschend.  Ohne die genannten Einschränkungen bei den Multiuserfähigkeiten und der Familienbibliothek würde ich 5 Sterne vergeben.
5018	1	a	The control are awful the enemy is a professional and no difficulty setting the enemy get the power ups all the time a complete waste of time.
5019	1	a	There seems to be an issue with the game. Once I get to the bandits, at the very beginning of the game, every choice I make results in an error message and I can't continue.
5020	1	a	Une fois tout rempli impossible de s'enregistrer. Dommage l'idée est bonne.
5021	1	a	I didn't really care for it.
5022	1	a	Fun. But ads is in the wrong place. Its in the way. 1 tiny move can trigger the ad. There are really innapropriate ads too. Also 2 touchy game screen
5023	5	a	Nice app. You should add all 24 position.
5024	5	a	I love the app because it give you time to think like should I eat this or should I Mao and it is all your choice
5025	5	a	Hey guys what do you feel ex. If you are a game maker then every one said your game is so bad not good think before speak guys all of you have no heart remember what I said.

5028	3	a	I like how it's laid out but wish the vitamin database was bigger and included evening found in the vitamin and supplement section at the drugstore
5029	2	a	Was the best basic calculator I've come across for Android phones. But... \nwith a recent Android update, the phone keyboard pops up at unwanted times \nmaking usability quite poor.
5030	5	a	.. But the idea it self so much useful
5031	4	a	Easy to use, but with great options for customisation and tweaking. Appearance and interface is rather straightforward - but I wouldn't want any frilly extras on an app like this. So far, it's the best app of it's kind that I've found. I especially appreciate being able to view your shifts by all/week/month/year as it is easy to see how many hours you are owed as 'time off in lieu' - this is often overlooked by other developers as most people are simply paid overtime. Thanks!
5032	1	a	The notification just won't go away.
5033	5	a	I keep tyiping words they just don't knoam so blessed hhhhhhhhhh i s

5037	1	a	It cant fly straigh. Waste time like other said.
5038	5	a	Had theme two years or more \u0026 must say it's one of a few favorites i have. I like the clean simplest but yet stylish look icons. Ived used them by themselves with live wallpapers because of there clear appearance that goes with absolutely anything. I will most definitely continue to use this trouble free theme till the end of time. Thanks so much for ur creatively, great work.
5039	4	a	This game is soooo fun! It is the hardest game I have ever played! The only problem is that the ads can get in the way of rolling. I wish you would only have ads at the top!

5044	2	a	The graphics are poor especially considering the size of the app. Elf Yourself is much  better imo

5050	2	a	This is a really good game and I would have given a 5 star to but it kept freezing and stopping making me lose coins that I had earned. I tried to play it on my HP TABLET AND MY GALAXY SAMSUNG 3 PHONE and it did the same thing on each one. Fix the problem and I will give it a 5 star rating.Thanks
5051	3	a	Not bad quite complex for a free app but the whole display is so dark its almost unreadable

5058	5	a	Love the app shows a lot. Down fall is I wish it would possibly show the other entitlement check and if possible the info if they forced me to get a mark on my settings for there network optimization program. Because I've had issues the past few weeks with signal and I'm trying to get them to fix it. In Ohio we had a earthquake 25 days ago and my signal has been horrid I went from a pretty steady solid higher three signal to a lower to mid 4 signal with leaves on the trees to this crappy two

5094	5	a	When the new smarttag releases, will this software add support for them? Those green and Orange tags. Update: Brilliant! NT2 supports.
5095	4	a	Clunky controls. Entertaining gameplay. I like the story. Nice graphics. \nOverall a good game.
5096	2	a	For ps4 there displaying right combos but the description to use there using xbox format. is it to hard to say x instead of a or use o instead of b? Im using ps4 not xbox use the, x,o,^ and square for ps4 not xboxs layout
5097	3	a	I would instantly buy this if it was in HD for my tablet. But it looks pixelated so I have to miss out.

5099	5	a	Awesome I love stickman games . I like calling them slimy , hahahaaaaaaa
5100	5	a	Works on Chromecast and Samsung Galaxy Note 3.  Definitely the best app of its type.  Small adverts at the bottom of the TV screen but these can be removed via simple in app donation!
5101	3	a	Low stars due to half the things not loading.
5102	1	a	It is bad to sarobat the eye and pararot
5103	5	a	good app for larn english
5104	5	a	It looks so good behind my texting
5105	4	a	Really good simulation game just feels like a pilot from the cockpit camera view just need something more like reverse thrust to stop after landing and most obvious reversing the aircraft the game is awesome but if you add reversing then it will rock the play store
5106	5	a	As addictive as flappy bird.
5107	5	a	Good and scary and pls make another monster to kill me that is my wish
5108	3	a	Can't clear the adds. Adds block the aim of your shot. Losing to much screen to adds. You lose interest in the game because the adds run to long. Could be a great game with out the adds but im guessing ill have to pay to remove them
5109	1	a	After every game I can't click play again so I have to close the app and reopen to get it to work.
5110	5	a	It looks really awesome, but it doesn't work on my phone (Galaxy sIII). Is there a PC version I could play instead?
5111	5	a	sir main ye app download kiya or mera mobile lock ho gaya hai mujhe password bhejiye ya mujhe password bhej kjar unlock kar dijiye
5112	5	a	Very nice and good I like it very much
5113	5	a	This game is so cool i dont no about u but i think that is is the best peopl that made this game shoud make more that is how good this game is poepl that dont like omg men or girl this is the best u poepl thwt put 2 stars what do u mean like do u like it or not
5114	5	a	This is the first app I load on a new phone. Simple, fast to update. Storm \ntrack has not worked on three different phones but its still the best radar \napp. Wish there was an auto map update. Instead you have to move the map a \nbit to updated radar image.
5115	4	a	There is a blinking stripe on the right side on the galaxie S4. Except that, it is a awesome background!
5116	3	a	It's ugly and buggy, but lets me check pics clearer at my phone's bigger screen. I don't rely on remote shooting, cause it isn't instant when pressed on screen. I've never liket it, but the alternative Cannon Connect made me sick trying to connect. Never connected haha. My advice is to choose this EOS remote instead. Basic utility but quite useful for previewing. I reccomend trying USB controlling based apps. I have one and its georgeous.
5117	5	a	Great work, very good information, May God bless you Mr Kazmi, Good work again
5118	3	a	But u cant get away from it so its difficult. Make it so we can have hiding places, like in alien isolation
5119	1	a	my kids were trying to play but when said D it sounded like G.plus 5 others.a kid cannot learn from this game it would be very very very confusing.so uninstalling \u0026 finding another game that u can understand.seriously disappointed......
5120	4	a	Unique, you use analytical process hehehe
5121	4	a	Still has bugs. Gets in a loop where go back kicks you out, not undoes the last play.
5122	5	a	This app helps keep track of ur diet trust me also check out my YouTube channel- leyla holley
5123	5	a	I know i dont need it anymore, but i'll keep it. It is a great shortcut and it was super when there was no better.
5124	4	a	It would be awesome if the app had an option to randomly mix my clothes instead of me choosing the look.  :)
5125	4	a	Good good just I kept lagging I turned into. A deformed kite
5126	1	a	when I touch it, it just closes.

5129	1	a	The worst filters I've seen,Sketch Cam is by far superior and it's free.
5130	5	a	This is the perfect budget app for me. I really wanted to like Mint, but it was just way too complicated for what I needed. This is the only app I am installing on my new phone. I'd love an iPad version, but I'm happy to have it regardless. A note to the person wondering how to set the overall budget amount - the app automatically sets the amount after adding up the totals in all your categories. So to increase or decrease the total, add or subtract money from the categories. Wonderful app, highly recommend
5131	5	a	It was so cool!!! I thank you shode get it .
5132	5	a	직거래로 좋은 제품을 저렴한 가격에 만날 수 있다는 점이 마음에 쏙 듭니다. 많은 직거래 앱들이 사용성이 어렵거나 불편한 부분이 많은데 이 앱은 사용하기도 참 쉽게되어있네요. 좋습니다. :)
5133	2	a	This is pretty useless - if you have the map loaded up, then move out of coverage (e.g. travel away from the free wifi location where you got the map up) then it stupidly tries to do a refresh, blanking out the screen with a holding page.. This is really dumb behaviour.  However, the map is good, and seems up to date.  The service seems only to be a timetable, and you can't plan a journey except by eyeballing the map..  Does support English.
5134	5	a	Still evaluating it, but so far looks really good. Not using it for golf, only for quick ranging.
5135	5	a	I am using it since months in different countries and it never disappointed me at least. I love it for its simplicity, ease of use and outstanding results. Though there is always room for improvement but still its the best i think in its range. I rank it 5* but wish to give 6.. Great job.
5136	4	a	But please i really need a reply to this,can the downloaded pdf plan on your website be viewed in 3d without the QR code? or do we need to print the QR code too?
5137	1	a	Erroneous... Time zone n lagna calculation faulty
5138	1	a	This app has potential for its all-in-one potential but it isn't working.  It is blocking my contacts even though I told it to allow everyone except 800 and anonymous!
5139	5	a	אפליקציה טובה,צריכה השלמה של כמה ערים בארץ. שלחתי כמה  איימלים--אף אחד לא חזר אליי. חבל.
5140	1	a	On andr 6.0 have experiencing a lot of lags
5141	5	a	Does everything you need from a golf app. Very accurate and easy to use.
5142	5	a	A very cool temple run styled game, powerups are very cool
5143	1	a	The app indicated that it had backed up all of my messages and when I went to restore them it only had backed up the last 10..so now I basically lost 5000 messages that I needed to save..Terrible app..sorry I downloaded it.
5144	5	a	Yes yes yes but it needs some more of the songs
5145	5	a	Great game,more people should like it!
5146	5	a	amazing flow chart storytelling! so well thought out and polished, hard to believe that it's a free android game.
5147	2	a	Looks are allright. Slow as ... Though
5148	3	a	I would love to keep using it but it seems that development and support fell off after about 2012.
5149	3	a	Sound doesn't work all the time on the game.
5150	5	a	Excellent application, works well on all devices i tried so far, from lg gw620 to htc desire s till samsung galaxy s2.
5151	5	a	"This is an AMAZING color background! I just LUV it!!! U gotta get it!!! Purple is my most FAV color!!! Wud b better without all those \things\""! Watever they r!!! Oh well! Who cares! :-D :-)"""
5152	5	a	I used to use the one released from Google but that one doesn't let you use the hard-keyboard to type Korean. This one does. 감사함니다.
5153	2	a	Just changed everything I said about this game being great.  Sure it's fun, but so extremely  frustrating.   They think that I don't know that they can look up your user account and see every transaction and more you make.   Game locks up and you games won before the crash.   Even crashes when spinning for your 4 hour bonus. Lose your bonus opportunity.   It is too frustrating to  play.  This was  the second time I downloaded the game.  I don't know if again
5154	4	a	Its a nice theme however, google search icon is blank. There are several little bugs with. This theme. Some of which already in reviews. PLEASE FIX!
5155	1	a	Can't log in. Won't let me create a profile. Flat out sux!
5156	2	a	Foarte faina muzica. Foarte instabila aplicatia. O data la cateva minute se opreste din cantat ca si cum ar pierde semnalul. Alte aplicatii de radio nu au problema asta.
5157	5	a	Very helpful for live performance
5158	5	a	Great fun to play game
5159	5	a	It is an excellent app! You can have  so many pets. Bunnies, cats, dogs. It is awesome!

5166	4	a	I like this game but aiming controls make it kinda tricky
5167	5	a	Its great .it shows me what happened to my money, and its very simple, flexible... thnk you guys..
5168	1	a	video streaming funktioniert nur in oesterreich, abgesehen von den werbeclips..
5169	1	a	Its nt working in my phone..very bad
5170	4	a	Хорошая игра. Хотелось бы больше статистики, в частности больше информации о количестве поражений, побед и ничейных результатов. А в идеале привязка к сайту вконтакте.
5171	2	a	I hate the updated version . . . The ball it's getting smaller. . . The movements is much faster this time . . It scratch all the time bec the ball it's a bet smaller to me . .pls. Bring back the old ball size. It's not the same anymore . . . I play this everyday . ...  I'm using this since Symbian . . . In my old Nokia phone . . .
5172	1	a	I wanted to buy a garmin product with the deal claiming up to 60% off. Not one of the products had 60% off they were all 20% off. Emailed them about it and never heard back. TOTALLY USELESS UNINSTALLED WITH MALICE
5173	4	a	Put in two tracking numbers and worked instantly faster and more reliable then the USPS app.
5174	5	a	My grand kids can play this they are 5 \u0026 2
5175	4	a	A change needs to be made. The extra ship could have a lower price. For example, the ship price could be 400.
5176	2	a	Is not what I see here is what I see offline so the app is not OK for me
5177	1	a	I could not even click on any thing and have it open .click on the calender that wont open same with anything i try to open
5178	1	a	THIS IS CRAP! PAY FOR EVERYTHING OR DON'T INSTALL! in other words no way am I keeping this app! All bears are there and my lil guy cried because he couldn't use a different one! Thanks from a heartbroken 3 year old!! And to all the other people rating this app.. how old are you?? Like 7?? Just askin cause you all sound like babies givin good feedback on this crappy app!! It's called uninstalling and I'm doing it right now
5179	5	a	Really enjoy playing game. Just wish there were more levels to play.
5180	5	a	Thi app is hot like fire.
5181	3	a	The French is awful, the pronunciation is wrong. Don't no about the other languages though. HTC EVO
5182	1	a	But mystery stop of game every time I play has ruined thine experience fer me.  Reported several times over course of a month, increasing in frequency, and no response of any kind.  Retarded, and not gonna let the game bother me no more.  Deleted.  Also number two as well, not even giving it a chance.
5183	5	a	It's Free! I didn't have to pay or jump through any hoops. 👍👍 🐸🐼🐻 🐨🐯🐶 🙈🙉
5184	5	a	This is the best and very easy audio trimmer I've found so far. Would recommend to those who wants an easy and very reliable audio trimmer and would deliver the job. Great app! Deserved 5 stars!
5185	5	a	Options that I can now play with
5186	3	a	I just wish they would release an update for it.. Have had the game a few years and it has never been expanded upon... Where's eufloria 2 already!?  Had to take 2 stars away... been way too long without  a significant update
5187	2	a	Impossible to play on HTC Wildfire because the keypad overlaps with the blue fields where letters are added.
5188	3	a	I downloaded this app so I could use emojis on my contacts. At first ot worked but it won't work now. Please fix it.
5189	2	a	Ok well ur supposed to move and shoot not do 360 all day an no quick about it soooo for the ppl who said its a good game u don't quick scope u just shoot at random spining around like ur controller is broke
5190	2	a	Tried the trial version. Words of phrases are out of order. Speaks too fast. No distinction between male and female.  Not convinced to buy..
5191	4	a	"Not sure how I can \Rate\"" an application I have only just installed. It \nappears to be VERY GOOD on initially going through the basic options. Have \ninstalled this looking for PARANORMAL voice activity. Will be delighted to \ngive feedback when I have been able to use the VOICE ACTIVATED setting."""
5192	4	a	Great i love the splitscreen multiplayer.. could you also make a control scheme where there is a gas peddal always pressed and the forward arrow would be a brake? Most samsung phones have problems with multitouch on the edges of screens. Also sometimes the car goes to almost a halt and i have to wait like 5 sec.. why?
5193	4	a	יכולה להיות מאד נוחה, אבל ניהול רשימות הקניות והמעבר מרשימת קניות לרשימה לקניה אונליין מאד מסורבל ולא ברור. מדי פעם יש הפסקות בשירות, לא ניתן להזמין וזה מאד מתסכל.
5194	1	a	How do you even turn the snake. I hate it. And it's boring.
5195	1	a	It won't let me play all it does is freeze up my whole system.
5196	1	a	A game with no explanation that makes sure you always lose. Waste of time.
5197	5	a	Reminds me of those good old Sinclair Spectrum games I played as a kid.
5198	5	a	Great game and runs smoothly with awesome graphics
5199	5	a	Good game, but too many ads
5200	4	a	The story isn't much but it's a fun time killer for me. You can earn in game currency pretty easy so it's surprisingly not a cash grab.
5201	3	a	It's fun to play to pass some time but could add more upgrades
5202	5	a	This a fabulous game of the same company I would like to download.make up me super star,
5203	1	a	Why would your CS tell me to download this app to sign in but when I try to, it tells me can only create ID in-game? Sometimes I wonder if you even know how you're own apps work.
5204	1	a	Je l'ai effacé tout de suite.. Le site comme l'application sont mal faits! Quand je cherche un voyage pour 1 seule personne (moi) je reçois toujours le prix pour l'occupation double... Exemple Punta Cana 1850$ pour deux semaines.. Après quand je click pour réserver le site calcule et le prix est 2900$ ..  Pourquoi tu me fait entrer occupation simple si l'application n'est pas capable de calculer ça en partant ??
5205	5	a	I like Bond very much
5206	1	a	Luego de la primera búsqueda no sirvió más
5207	5	a	It is in support of your 90 minute sleep cycle if that's what you believe, \nand the theory of the cycle of deep sleep and r e m cycling which my \nprimary internist MD disclosed .. Occurring just so many times in a 7 1/2 \nhour night. For my feelings of satisfactorily having rested, sometimes it \nseems to work: more than 50%.
5208	4	a	Can use these to put on my pictures like am android version of instaemoji but there isn't enough emojis need to have an update to get all of the ones on iphones
5209	5	a	I love this game so much and bought most of the songs. But when buying a permanent notes, we hope there will be special popping effects just like in the real technika arcade machine, we hope you develop that in the future so that the notes has a worth of buying it.
5210	5	a	○(｡'ω'｡)○ omg I love it
5211	1	a	it's really bad and I don't like it. I hope no one will download again.
5212	5	a	Not to be Gay but I also love alpha the most he is just awesome he is so good I feel like hugging him to the core
5213	4	a	this app is pretty good, the messages need to stay where I scroll them to and not automatically scroll to the last message unless one has either arived or sent out, as for loads we should be able to remove  them from the list especially when the load has been taken from us or changed to someone else and a transfloed section should be add to the available  and accepted load that way we can track what loads have been transfloed
5214	1	a	Concept is good but need the support of truecaller.
5215	3	a	I have an old galaxy s4 that i wanted to use it on but I cant because it doesnt have a sim card so the wifi hotspot wont turn on. Oh well
5216	5	a	This is very good app for using the photo editing.
5217	1	a	This app worked great before I updated to Nougat, now it doesnt open my calendar when i click the widget like it used to.  Please fix it so it works with this update.
5218	5	a	This app should be over 4.5 stars.
5219	1	a	Doesn't work like others say-
5220	5	a	دست سازنده درد نکنه واقعا برنامه تاثیر گذاریه
5221	5	a	I ENJOY THIS GAME. I WISH THAT I COULD SEE IT BETTER. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I'VE PLAYED.
5222	2	a	It'd be nice if the discard pile would reset automatically.  I can't finish the game because of it.
5223	5	a	I love this game 😍😍😍😍😀😀😀
5224	5	a	This is one of the best games I have played Loved it
5225	2	a	It's ok. I think it needs more levels to play on. And you really have to work on the shooting, I'm just running around.
5226	5	a	Another quality game I first encountered as an indie pc game. Nothing has been lost in the transition to Android happily! The minimalist visuals and gentle ambient soundtrack and sound effects really allow the simple but addictive gameplay to shine, and it works wonderfully with the touch interface. Highly recommended
5227	4	a	I'm happy the webforms are working in the latest open source version. Love it. I love adding new opportunities on the fly and keeping in Sync. Thanks @vtiger.
5228	5	a	Thus game is good .they really outdid themselves in making it.What i really like is how your characters changes its costume for each weapon/spell
5229	5	a	I was able to unlock the tethering block from Lycamobile on my Samsung Galaxy 3.
5230	4	a	Doesn't connect to contacts great but it pretty much gets what you say correct.
5231	1	a	After 'pulling' rope, only idles, no matter how I tilt it. No sound on stock DX either. Uninstalled.
5232	2	a	Jól látom, hogy a késleltetett adás nem is nézhető ezzel az appal??? Mondjuk amúgy sem, a honlaptól sem... báj-báj
5233	3	a	It doesn't show up on my display box thingy!! Please help me!! Xxx
5234	5	a	Awesome game. Surely one of the best. Thankfully, for me the game loaded every time till the completion. I have played four games of alawar entertainment, and all are superb games.
5235	3	a	"very well under normal light. I like the full screen. But doesn't work with the led at all. \Magnify\"" does. Droid x."""
5236	2	a	No permite agregar cuentas de servicios básicos, sale en este momento no esta disponible.
5237	5	a	Great App. Merci! Can you just add in a place on how to properly pronounce the words. Merci. Overall great app.
5238	5	a	It's a way of relaxation It helps to relief stress Very useful in day today life Best way of meditation As it's in  ur mobile u can carry it anywhere
5239	5	a	Easy use, now I know exactly how many devices connected to my wifi
5240	5	a	"Hey its great but there a small herror in the arabic layut when u press L and A \lam\"" and \""alef\"" the result is LAA or \""lam\"" double \""alef\"" plz fix it!"""
5241	3	a	I did not like the sound options of this app. I prefer a subtle simple beep or ping to let me know time is up. I don't think anymore than that is necessary and can be distracting, defeating the purpose of the app.
5242	5	a	Amazing and great stress reliever just hearing the wind as you just gliding about. I always play this just before heading off to bed
5243	5	a	I love this theme ...cute and lovely its cool ...
5244	2	a	In Australia especially, This APP needs to be available in an offline 'STANDLONE \u0026 GPS reliant' version, rather than only being partly or wholely'Internet/Data \u0026 GPS reliant' to operate Dear developer, aside of similar apps on the market, your app works great provided/assuming that a user's smartphone has wireless or data services available, \u0026 that user's are within a wireless/data reception area for their particular Mobile Service provider e.g Vodafone, Optus, Telstra etc. Turning on GPS obviously is not the problem, it is that in order to use this APP there is the requirement to have access to data services/internet that is the issue. This should be CLEARLY stated on APP description/features/requirements. I was unaware that your system relies solely on having wireless internet/data services available to operate! In Australia, this is simply an archaic expectation due to the fact that hundreds of towns, even suburbs have little, singular (i.e. only one Mobile provider), or non existent reception \u0026, 1000's of areas with blackspots exist everywhere. So, still then, many people who DO have wireless internet/data services connected(available) are affected in the same way regardless!
5245	5	a	Hello Sync it team @Lennovo. It's a humble request to you that please never stop the development plan. I have my entire life's important texts and contacts in sync it database. Thanks and regards, Dev
5246	4	a	Would give it 5 stars but just don't know why it needs access to my photos.
5247	5	a	I love that it let's me set how many cigs I wanna smoke in a day n notifies me when it's time to smoke so I can bank it for later or smoke it.  I do need sumthing that breaks it down like this!! It's great! Should hv sumthing like this for saving money too!! Haha! Well maybe I'll just bank the money I'm saving per day then too cuz I see now how much I was spending!

5250	5	a	Great concept... Good graphics and play. So far a couple minutes in and looks like a game I'll really enjoy. Been looking for something like this. The control needs a Lil work but overall great game. Keep up the good work! Really will look to see what else you'll come up with.
5251	1	a	Stock Android alarms but with advertisements. Ugh!
5252	3	a	I keep downloading the course, and re downloading the course, and re downloading the course. Wasting all my data... It's good for streaming, but don't bother downloading your course unless you want to waste all your data on downloading something that will just dissappear. Galaxy Note 3
5253	1	a	Doesn't work with LG g2
5254	5	a	When I played this fell in love lol
5255	1	a	useless I cant even change my hair nah or I should say I cant even use it because it doesnt show anything while using it except advertisement
5256	4	a	I really like this translate it was good this is something I will pay 4
5257	4	a	Nice clear lettering. Need to be carefull when shaking between scrolls as it will jump out of sequence. Good app though girls s freebie.
5258	1	a	You can playabout 3 levels, then you have to pay for berries - hard to predict how much, as only two berries cost nearly a dollar and with that you can't even buy a single upgrade
5259	1	a	What kind of controls are these
5260	1	a	Total crap.....won't or can't be utilized @ all. No pics @ all appear as wallpaper...I have it all set up \u0026 I get nothing....Had to delete but it won't let me yet. Don't fall for it \u0026 nothing's free!!! It starts out for free one day \u0026 then it disappears conveniently.  Nice trick.
5261	3	a	I will give 5 if it's good.
5262	1	a	When I park the car on the first level what do I do? I can't get on the second level because of this. by the way I'm deleting it DONT GET THIS APP
5263	1	a	Fal2 app,,  pehleto bola free version me call beck hoga bad kamino ne  dixaya free version me nhi to kamino free version banate kyu ho
5264	1	a	I have been using this app for 4 years now and purchased the license 4 years ago. I changed my phone to one plus X and the settings menu has disappeared. I am able to add fill up etc, but can't export the data. I need to reset my phone but will lose all the data. I even mailed the developer, but he didn't even bother replying.. Please don't buy it...
5265	3	a	Keep the option for language change. Atleast english.
5266	2	a	Was very disappointed when wi-fi only stayed connected for couple minutes at a time.
5267	2	a	Ads ads ads!  Lame looking scenes.  Hard to change
5268	5	a	I love this app.. I'll be subscribing to your  u tube
5269	5	a	I don't know about grownups, but my 4yr old plays it. Thanks!
5270	5	a	Lets u set everything in the app
5271	1	a	Every time I try to select a photo from my gallery the app instantly force closes. So its basically useless
5272	5	a	나 한국 키보드를 졸라 좋아해
5273	1	a	so after playing shortly , i decided to test if this app is random rolls .... i played dont pass for 50 points , the last 30 points i lost 27 times most of which were hops .... then i played pass for 50 points and sure enough the tables turned and i sevened out 38 of 50 points ... kinda thinking this app is made to get you to buy chips 😖🤔🙄
5274	1	a	dont use this one. i entered some casual notes into this notetaking app and the next day, noticed an entire page of notes i entered the day before are missing. and the advertisements are kind of sketchy and shady. like are u trying to make a good effective app or just trying to get an app on a persons phone just so u can advertise things..
5275	1	a	Truly dreadful. Nothing works properly!
5276	1	a	Only two choices of colour, brown or yellow. Have to buy the whole package if you want any more. Realise you have to make a profit, but at least give us a chance to see if we would actually like the game. UNINSTALLING
5277	4	a	Seems a little intimidating at first, but when you start getting in the swing of things it becomes much easier. Provides a lot of information and explanation. The only thing I can think to add would be vocal recognition to help with pronunciation. I would recommend to anyone who is learning Japanese.
5278	4	a	I quit using ADW when it didn't play nice with my Droid.  I want try it again but I see there hasn't been an update in almost two years.  I hope the developer is okay as it appears further development has completely stopped.  I hope it's because he has more exciting things going on in his life and that he'll return when he can...  He has devoted so much time and effort into all aspects of this launcher and it will be such a shame if it's abandoned...
5279	5	a	F   Lokvyjihujo to get your email to you soon mate of a sudden and then delete this communication or distribution in a couple days to
5280	1	a	This game doesn't work on my phone!
5281	3	a	I wish on the nonograms it would cross out the row when conditions are satisfied
5282	3	a	not a very fun game but 3 stars for the controls
5283	1	a	So lame! All it dose is takes back to my home menu!!! So plz work on my iPod I have!
5284	5	a	I love the app and love the rap songs!!!! Keep up the good work.
5285	1	a	I am using HTC ONE M8.... This is a an awesome keyboard just the prob is with auto correct. Add a option where the keyboard will show the suggestion but will not auto correct it. Please bring this a small change but makes a big difference because of this i am using a 3rd party keyboard (Android L)
5286	1	a	"I purchased a pride card for the first year from my school, and was curious about using this app to see what other deals I could get in my community. However, when I tried to access my account for the first time, it said my serial number was in use on another device, and I'd need to reset my password to fix this issue. Having looked up half an hour of bug fixes and getting 25 new password links all deemed \invalid\"" I finally decided this app was no longer worth my time. Major dissapointment."""
5287	4	a	That is the best camera app I found, the filters are sick! I live for those filters! Please upgrade the API so the Nexus 5X is not upside down! Please let me put the 5 stars back!
5288	3	a	I can't do it. Its too hard. It would be better if you could use a pic form ur gallery
5289	5	a	Only Civil Engineers can only comment this App.................. for me this App is useful  for civil Engineere students
5290	3	a	You can only play 5 levels before they expect you to pay to unlock the other levels- which is so not worth it. It is hardly worth it being a *free* game.
5291	5	a	Just like Super Mario Brothers
5292	2	a	poor and tedious it spoils any fun you might have. Uninstalled.
5293	2	a	Great i want the colors

5296	5	a	I have no complaints about this app. I just like to change things up. Had it on my phone for 4 months straight :^)
5297	5	a	Fun but I wish when you got extra hearts they would let u keep them and use them once u lost one.
5298	1	a	Cannot view the account statement.why have you named it e passbook when i \ncannot view todays transactions????? Money suckers charging for each and \neverything and these are the kind of facilities.. Shamefull
5299	5	a	It will tell in future if I can get all data after restoration
5300	3	a	Cannot recover data from old phone after upgrading...not useful.
5301	5	a	Good work... dinakkondu kagga geleyarigu share madi DVG yavaranna neneyona...
5302	4	a	It's a nice app. It helped me a lot in roaming around Boston and discovering the tourist places to visit.
5303	4	a	I like this app a lot!! I am learning Japanese by myself and it is really helpful and the material is easy to understand. Animations don't work for me though (and my phone is a 2016 model samsung so idk why) and also one quiz from hiragana part included a question from the next chapter.
5304	1	a	I do not like boney seed because every time tall me has stopped
5305	1	a	FULL of AD games, \u0026 low graphic quality. Im DELETING it.
5306	4	a	I have used dis app for many occasions.... N I m very well happy with it. Only thing is sometimes it gets stuck...
5307	5	a	This is a fairly simple game with plenty of challenges to beat. The game is good fun and can be enjoyed by anyone of all ages.
5308	1	a	This is rather stupid. How come only the camera works?
5309	1	a	Did not work on my nexus :(
5310	5	a	There's a huge difference when playing with filters... Makes the gameboy console look dumb ;-)
5311	1	a	I wrong for 5 star
5312	1	a	Its the worst app doesnt even work
5313	1	a	This app was a lousy app and it not able to login after update. This is call a internatioanal bank? SC mobile key keep asking to register but when want to register it fail, try few time than will show that the apps not responding. Very dissappointed
5314	5	a	Excellent game \u0026 so addicting! I love it!
5315	1	a	Horrible, seems like the whole point of having this app is to check while you're away from the TV. Nothing comes up on mobile. Think we can get it fixed before Notre Dame next week?
5316	5	a	My galaxy core supports 5 touches simultaneously.
5317	3	a	I used to have it on my other phone and it was so cute omg. I download it for my new phone but when I try to apply it, it crashes and doesn't work. Please help~
5318	5	a	I loved it I thought it was cool but there's not enough power ups and do you need the pit well use money to get the other things but y'all use people to buy them instead of using the money on the game the more money on the game the more peopl e will play it to get more power ups sorry for the long message but that's how I think but your game is awesome
5319	5	a	This app is the best in its kind. Please keep adding the content. More enthusiastic to listen to Swamiji's quotes
5320	5	a	The best LWP I've seen yet. Gorgeous scenery and NO ADS!
5321	3	a	Come on G5, I've paid to unlock this game and get there are still HUGE adverts popping up on my screen. I don't think it's acceptable really. The gameplay is still fun though.
5322	5	a	Its a very cool app.... I love it
5323	1	a	I tried numerous ways of pushing ok on the screen, but the game didn't recognize that. I could not progress past the 1st level because I was unable to push OK to advance to the next level. Very disappointing for a game I loved years ago.
5324	1	a	this app sucks! installed it took a picture and then uninstalled wrost quality ever. not worth downloading.
5325	3	a	Not scary and some of stoires are incomplete and others make no sense. A menu that let's you which story to read be helpful
5326	1	a	Se intrerupe des si apar multe dificultati la repornire sau oprire...
5327	5	a	This app is REALLY beautiful.
5328	4	a	I like the game. It really relieves stress and my favorite part of the game is when you click on the magic wand at the bottom and it tell you if you have a wrong value then it will show you where it is at and you can change it for your pleasure
5329	3	a	Crashes a lot and the step pictures of what you want to build, obstruct the picture that tells you what bricks you need for that step. The best example of this is on the castle.  Bit more work needed to make this app 5 stars.
5330	5	a	pretty decent I order anyway so it's a nice thing to spend the points every now and then
5331	3	a	App doesnt save location and so location needs to be entered multiple times after pressing back on the app, also doesnt seem to be saving multiple locations as it looks like it wants to allow (for instance City West and Melbourne CBD) .. otherwise it looks ok so far but it would be great to add more info to profile and have entered locations save- keep up the good work than you for fixing this in advance! Edit- after 3rd try 2nd location is now showing in 'Watch Zones' but still does not show entered 'My Location' that should show up top of screen
5332	5	a	A mainstay game through my last 3 phones
5333	2	a	When im using Galaxy S3 (android 4.2) its 100% work and be my the best apps. When i switch to Galaxy S5 (kitkat 4.4) the SMS not work liked before.. To ThinkYeah, please, please \u0026 please fix it. I really love this apps before.
5334	4	a	"I found this lesson handy.  Within just a few minutes i can understand how thai number works.  Love the \quize-like\"" method.  One thing lack is the exit button. And would be better if the audio is set a little bit faster as I don't think  thai language is spoken that slow."""
5335	5	a	Just wanted a nice looking animated wallpaper for the winter and this fit the bill.  I didn't know about the accelerometer when I downloaded it, which just made it even better. Beautiful!!
5336	5	a	Its a good game plus I eat burgers :D
5337	5	a	beautiful - pretty graphics and doesn't slow down my S8
5338	5	a	Now I'm free from that annoying click sound
5339	1	a	" jonka jälkeen luovutin ja poistin ohjelman jatkuvan kaatuilun vuoksi. Välttäkää."""
5340	5	a	Omg can not get enough  if this
5341	2	a	This game sounds great but it's limiting and a tired theme. The village building sounds more interesting than it actually is in play. Plus it locks up my phone constantly between levels. Feel like i just got had by a used car salesman. Uninstall.
5342	1	a	It requires to be unlocked everytime even after purchasing it. Monthly subscription rate is Rs 1111 which is quite high. I used it during Raid de Himalaya 2017 and regret it till now . My advice to anyone who wants to download it is do it at your own risk. Its not worth it.
5343	1	a	It did not even show up on my phone!
5344	5	a	Hi ho hu me boring  to wait dowload like others game
5345	2	a	Downloaded several times on 2 different galaxys. Will not open! Looks really cool... bummed
5346	1	a	Didnt move youtube or google play
5347	5	a	Could have been better if few games are free in D E and F
5348	5	a	I Love It Awesome Game!
5349	1	a	This game sucks. You should go download Dr.Driving. This game looks really good but it is not. The trucks are slowly and you have to wait a long periodically(😂) time to start the game.
5350	5	a	Thank you!! Other apps failed. Yours keeps mine on after screen off even when I had already set sleep to never. Droid
5351	2	a	They keep turning into crystals idk why though but it keeps happening over and over and over its rare for you to see in your games saying what I think about it so please fix it or its just my stuff idk
5352	4	a	Quick Easy Great little game
5353	2	a	This game is exceedingly worse then Turbo Dismount. It's riddled with Pop-Ups and Micro-Transactions for almost everything. The gameplay is also Painfully less interactive then it's predecessor, Turbo Dismount. Why? I'm really disappointed in this game and it's developers after making something as fair and fun as Turbo-D.
5354	5	a	Awesome. Ive been waiting for a game like this on Google play. Exactly what I was waiting for. I originally downloaded this over a year ago and this is a go to game for any RTS player absolutely wonderful well  I wish you could build your own buildings but hey you know maybe they'll come out with another game afterwards but these guys know what they're doing and they did a great job. It has triggered my nostalgia for the original warcraft and command \u0026 conquer series of games.
5355	3	a	I would give this 5 stars because its an awesome app but I've tried emailing for support and no one ever replied. I have an issue with information being cut off at the bottom and I cannot edit some information. Fix this and improve your customer service and I will consider 5 stars.
5356	2	a	It could use some help on detail and 0preration.
5357	3	a	Used to work great then just stopped working reloaded but still does not work. Always wants to be restarted. HTC incredible
5358	1	a	This game is stupid it makes my phone freeze and every time I try to play it I have to turn my phone all the way off and cut it back on y'all need some better game I liked all the other duty driver games but this game is just ugh and no effort was put into this game I hate this game.
5359	1	a	I'm having the same issue with 3 of the developers apps. They would not refund me for these apps after I purchased them and they had stopped working all of a sudden. Now the app asks me to purchase again if I want to use the full version of the game.
5360	5	a	I like it !!!!!!!! Here you have 5 stars from me
5361	1	a	None of video call apps work.. Hangouts n Skype do not work in htc one m8. I thought this is your premium phone and it's a horrible experience.  Please fix asap
5362	4	a	It would be awesome if they provide   up to date news and deploy more cameras
5363	1	a	Tous les 6 mois je telecharge l'app en espérant pouvoir profiter de qq programmes de qualité (de plus en plus noyés dans la pub...) et tous les 6 mois je supprime l'app sous 24h parce qu'elle ne fonctionne pas. Le streaming ne marche pas les gars !!! 1 min et après, des interruptions incessantes jusqu' à l'arrêt complet. Bref, ça ne sert a rien. Rassurez moi, vous n'avez pas payé pour cette app. Adieu Nova, dommage
5364	4	a	"Works on HTC G2. Interface could use little refining. Why is the off button labeled \of\""."""
5365	5	a	Good app for my own app store
5366	5	a	This is a stunning, detailed and beautiful theme that looks awesome on my Lucid
5367	4	a	I really like this, the flames themselves are pretty to watch and constant, making you feel as though maybe your phone is in the depths of hell. Great if you're in a bad mood, or if you just want to watch some pretty flames!
5368	2	a	Actually i seems like it this app but there is no option to view the detail for what files that i must delete..this is for duplicate and clean download folder.
5369	4	a	When you look up a chord it shows you every inversion of it on the entire fretboard all at once, with an option to play it out loud. Useful!
5370	5	a	I wanted to unlock the puzzles, paid and still the puzzles are locked. What can I do now? Help!  UPDATE got it. My daughter loves this game. It is very intuitive and provides kids with positive reinforcement with each action that is completed.
5371	1	a	Won't let me log in
5372	1	a	It wont move it won't jump it won't place block NEVER DOWNLOAD
5373	1	a	Well, it would be great if playback didn't stutter and stop randomly. I have a galaxy s8+, so I doubt it's my phone's processor lagging.
5374	2	a	"Would be 5 stars if you could remove the ads. There is a button for remove ads, but it leads to \not found\"" in the store. Too bad. A few ads sometimes would be ok as Dev needs money. But the number of ads and length of them is way too much. Uninstalling."""
5375	5	a	It is very practical to use torch at night time!
5376	3	a	The Romancized version of the Chinese needs the accent marks to help Western speakers get the inflection right. The audio clues really are the best way, but it helps some of us to learn by reading as we hear. And some of the audio ques are just wrong or don't match the Romancized translation. And how can the words for Left Right and straight all be combined like that???  Working out some of these bugs and adding more features to help people read,  write and speak Chinese would make this a 5 star app.
5377	4	a	As many things in this world change....you just can't be a classic! Got addicted fast on this game.
5378	1	a	Stupid all I can say
5379	3	a	Cant rename those whatsapp audio files. It wount allow me to save it otherwise 5***** :) neway its cool
5380	1	a	Its not workiñg with me
5381	5	a	After some review of similar apps, I've chosen this one, because it really works and does not compress images, even huge ones. Please, add some modern design and this app will be the best in it's class.
5382	5	a	This app is great; since my fiancée goes to bed with the remote on her side of the bed, I don't have to worry about not being able to change channels while she's sleeping. I had to have the DirecTV Cinema Connection Kit (CCK) sent to me, but they sent it to me at no charge. All I did was set it up, connect it to my existing wireless network, and then got the app. The only thing that sucks about this app is that you need to have internet connectivity in order to control the DirecTV receiver.
5383	5	a	I have been annoyed for years that Google didn't display the date on the calendar app icon.   Today I finally decided to research the problem and found this app.   Works great.
5384	3	a	I use it for ad blocking, it's extremely easy to use, but it constantly crashes. By constantly I mean once or twice a day, enough to get seriously annoyed. It has a handy icon on top when on but you have to remember to check for it before you open an app. If you forget, you find out when you get bombarded by ads. And it's not easy to turn it back on either. There's no shortcut appearing after installation, I have to use my phone's search function to open it again. Overall 5 stars without issues, 3 stars as they are there
5385	5	a	Great intro to the thought processes and basic principles behind coding. Useful for anyone who is getting started and fun for anyone who likes puzzles
5386	1	a	Can't use I need refund
5387	5	a	This would be nice if there was a way to select how many moves to go back on. From about 1-10. I know this may be too easy, but it'd still make this a lot better. Also, this game makes surprisingly good practice for the real deal.

5391	3	a	Plz update for 18:9 displays... Because this game content is not fully showing in 18:9 displays... It is very annoying
5392	4	a	Made me interested in putting new designs
5393	5	a	I'm so loving this, the vast majority of the themes are beautiful no complaints here nope not one!  thanks keep up the good work :-)
5394	5	a	It is th best for kids
5395	4	a	Nice app. Looks nice, customizable. Only gripe is some force closing when long pressing a history and choosing to message someone. Using SGS3.
5396	4	a	Awesome 4 free app! Voice needs 2B slower \u0026 louder. Too fast \u0026 quiet 2B understood on the street  / in a crowd. Adding written / typed Hebrew \u0026 English might help. בודה toda :-)
5397	4	a	Accurate to Casino rules, however I have 2 small gripes. First, a lot of the time it doesn't register my taps and thinks I'm dragging the card instead of tapping it to send it to my low hand. Second, I wish there was a portrait mode. Otherwise, this is by far the best, most simple, and most accurate version for Android.
5398	1	a	tried several times online and offline, but the app failed miserably to get my location. This sucks.

5421	3	a	It's OK nothing like the other Mystic Diaries, expected it being much better,  a bit of a let down.
5422	4	a	As a free App, I certainly am not asking for the world on a platter.  The text could be more robust in terms of BOLD, underline, etc.  But it's fine for minor alterations.
5423	5	a	Simple and fun. I use it almost every day as a cool metronome when i play the guitar on my micro cube amp. or just to improvise on a drum machine.
5424	5	a	No ads ..finally..really smooth and gets the job done .. Just for this if there was a pro version will pay cause of the no ads part.

5436	3	a	Nice protein building game. But it lacks proper controls on a phone. Graphics are really great but it somewhat kills enjoyment when you  put your phone in Landscape mode to play it. Sometimes it's hard to reach from opposite ends.
5437	5	a	I am laughing my butt of here!!!
5438	1	a	Current update does not work at all. On a Samsung Galaxy A5 2016. Floating lyrics does not show up no matter how much I try since the latest few updates despite the fact that it shows on the notification bar. Please find a way to solve the issue
5439	5	a	Have you ever thought that the softkeys on your device sucked? Well, with this app, you have an extra layer of personalization. If the softkey doesn't work, you can always use a backup. Well worth the money. However, I do have one gripe with it; the back is usually stretched in landscape mode(1:1 or 1:1.66667). I'm on a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1(GT-N8013) running CM12 Nightly. It would be great if you would patch it. Edit: installed a new nightly, works perfectly.

5444	5	a	aplikasi yg sangat baik dan membantu meskipun bagi yg baru belajar bahasa arab
5445	4	a	Its very addicting and good game but the game ends in level 36 where everything is unlocked and nothing more to do... They should upgrade this part and add new features also how the exp works every person killed should be added but not the last life, this kinda makes the game irritating hope Dev fixes these problems other than that it is a good game.

5449	5	a	I like it to show off Android Phones
5450	4	a	Starts up with a white screen for about 30 seconds and then it crashes. This has been fixed in a really short amount of time.

5465	2	a	beacase it have only one kind of musice
5466	1	a	Ok - so having had this for a couple of years - up to last summer, I was able to get it to connect with my phone reliably and send messages.  It wasn't perfect, but the software was good enough.  The latest firmware and software update however have made maintaining a bluetooth connection to an Android phone next to impossible (apparently they fixed it for the iPhone). Now the only way to link it is to reboot both the device and the phone, delete the pairing, re-pair, then make a connection. This is annoying, but possible at the start of a walk. I want to use it during a walk to send a message I have to reboot both again, thus terminating tracking! The fact that the s/w had been this broken for this long on a subscription device is not acceptable, and I'll be calling Spot again soon to see what they plan to do to resolve it.     Support suggested that if the disconnect happens in the field, I delete the bluetooth pairing, tap the device button to get the blue flash, and then I'll have 60 seconds to re-pair, without having to reboot the device. Will give it a go next time and report back.   Still no ETA on a real fix though.  Phone them up and complain until they fix this!
5467	3	a	It is more good if it works without internet.
5468	2	a	Does not open my attachment/s at all
5469	5	a	It works, for every plug in,  I was getting 60 more sms an hour.  I HAD TO POWER CYCLE MY PHONE FOR PLUGINS TO ACTIVATE.

5482	5	a	I forget things, so I use this timer often. I wish there more options such as 2-3 separate timers and options to label each events. I'm sure there are other apps out there that will do what I'm asking, but I really like this one. It's simple and easy.

5487	3	a	Can you make different volume for lefd and right ear
5488	1	a	Was fine up until the last few days when all of a sudden there are ads \nevery 5 mins. You can't have ads on myhome folks. Figure out another way to \nmake money, but it can't be ads. People will switch to a competitor.
5489	3	a	According to me this would be interesting game for those who are very creative.
5490	4	a	Well done! At last a nice and simple app to display your time, date, etc. There must be a lil bug though because  in the widget it doesn't display the weather! I'll rate it 5* if you fix this problem.

5500	2	a	I really wanted to like this keyboard, but unfortunately it's very difficult to use. One good thing about it is that you can switch between languages very easily, with the push of a key. The bad part is that is has a very hard time recognizing words and will replace it with something totally different than you wanted. Also, it's doesn't recognize the keys you press very well. Also, when  adding some type of symbol or manual emoticon it messes up the spacing all the time. It's a very inconvenient keyboard :(
5501	5	a	I used this app since 2012 or 13  don't remember. no problems ever. Every time I use it it takes me back to when I was younger always took pics. Used this app then it was always masterpiece .
5502	1	a	Keeps glitching please fix..its a fun game but i had to delete it because of the glitching
5503	2	a	Dev: Google the term 'framerate independence'. Or pay me $50 to convert your game over to be frame rate independent cause as is it is unreliable and unfun to die to jitters in the physics due to the frame rate fluctuating.
5504	1	a	It won't let me know If I wus color blind
5505	2	a	Need more development. Even we can't block or inactive the card in case of emergency

5514	1	a	This game feels more like it's on rails. The controls don't exactly control the character, so the game becomes very repetitive. The game is fun for a moment then it loses its flair. The best part is the secret block throwing mode.
5515	4	a	Great game, but please please please please update with a setting that allows the female commentary to be turned off. It's cheesy gets soooo annoying.
5516	4	a	I like those preety frames cause it is actually attracted to other people who can see it...what a nice frame:-)
5517	1	a	In one word, bad. This didnt load, and only had one language. I advise not to upload this onto play store unless this has been approved with multiple languages.  Without hesitation, out of ten i can easily give this zero. In my usual comments i would give a good and a bad side, but i never experienced this app to give a good side. Serious editing is required. I will re download this in a month. I hope for better results.

5522	4	a	I don't understand what they're saying but it's very amusing to just keep on tapping until she turns into something elsei
5523	3	a	I don't understand all your themes or packs.  Downloaded but didn't make any difference.  Also freezes when checking for messages from home screen so I have to switch to another sms app that doesn't freeze or lag.  Using a Blackberry Priv.  Overall, good app.
5524	5	a	Cold But With a chance of light flurries!
5525	1	a	ICan't control this car after play
5526	5	a	Old life music ring tone.
5527	3	a	other player paly any trump ...like a bigger .... it make so boring ...plz add higher level option also ....
5528	1	a	When complaint are made. They are closed without rectification. Very disappointed.
5529	5	a	Installed this app yesterday and I've had no connection loss since then. Of all the data connection apps I've tried this one actually has done the job...so far.
5530	5	a	Don't listen to all those other idiots making bad reviews.. The don't know what they're talking about. This app does its job and does it right!
5531	3	a	Slow paced...at level 2 and still waiting for the challenge. But I think I like it as it is...
5532	5	a	My recordings come out clearly even with my sneeses. Great app guys, it would be nice if there was a Select button thow. Over all good work. It is well worth getting
5533	5	a	Super like nice theme , thanks to developer!!
5534	5	a	Easy to set up, compact display with all info. Fast and useful for checking progress. I find the most important functions are all available.
5535	1	a	Used this for several years with some annoying issues here and there but \nkept it anyway. As of 5 days ago though it just randomly stopped working \nand won't show messages anymore and now all messages go to my default \ncarrier voicemail instead. I've tried reactivated the service but to no \navail. I think I'm done with this app and switching to regular AT\u0026T visual \nvoicemail since I can at least count on getting my messages and where they \nwon't mysteriously cut off after a few seconds. How unfortunate as I used \nto really rely on the app. Oh well. The only thing I can think of is that I \nupdated to Android 8 (Oreo) a few days ago so perhaps it just doesn't work \nwith the OS.
5536	5	a	Great app for Japanese tattoos it's help me out for ideas for tattoo I would like.
5537	2	a	Seems somewhat hard to cast
5538	3	a	... I've seen before on my friend's phones. But it won't work for my phone. I have a droid x 2.3.4 with 4.5.604 system version. Can you please make it work?
5539	4	a	В Татарстане не за всеми камерами поспевает, но вообще хорошее приложение.
5540	4	a	I would love the ability to combine text and and handwriting in same document.   I am a huge evernote user but don't like the color limitations and inability to move my handwriting around on the screen if i  need more room to add another idea in the middle. It does import into evernote but then I can't edit it.  So I will begin using this app w drive to go cross platform.
5541	1	a	No stars ,what the heck it is...?????????????
5542	3	a	This app is a rip off, it has real sounds but it just sucks
5543	5	a	The graphics on this game is unbelievable. Freaking awesome!! Thank you.
5544	3	a	A throwback to old time dungeon crawling RPGs, easy to learn controls, lots of monsters, easy combat, and a totally enjoyable game! Reminds me of Legend of Grimrock, a new oldstyle computer game, so now I can reminisce and enjoy a good dungeon crawl on my android devices. However, it appears that if you enter certain areas, you MUST coin to get out again! Dirty trick in my mind! Taking 2 stars off for wasting my time!
5545	4	a	Fun game though. I might purchase if the movement and menu screens were a tiny bit less clunky. Love the concept though.
5546	5	a	great. it would be nice if users could also delete zones!
5547	3	a	Bummed that it doesn't track fiber.  That's huge in low carb land!
5548	3	a	Both games wont boot up anymore. For such a big app not to work anymore means wasted space . And all of the  gunship games seem to be the games I was interestd in , now I cant get them to load. Thinking about uninstalling , dont want to but .
5549	2	a	App keeps freezing but OK when it works needs to have bugs worked out of it, then it'll get 5 stars, have to restart phone to get it to work sometimes very erratic.
5550	5	a	A bit boring but nice
5551	1	a	The only thing this app ACTUALLY does, is show your boot up time. It will NOT remove annoying apps from the startup list. Simply use the built in option to show apps that could not be disabled at startup, and it will tell on itself. Great idea, but in reality, could probably only truly work on a rooted device.
5552	5	a	Super hra, multiplayer som rád privítal. Ešte trochu vylepšiť UI a bude to tip top :)
5553	2	a	Very disappointing. Disguised as free game but to go any where beyond the first part you have to pay. Definitely going to uninstall.
5554	2	a	Picture quality goes down by 50% No option to give the background solid colours of your choice (can only use the ready to use gradients they provide)
5555	5	a	When my score is 3000 automatic stop huhuhu
5556	5	a	Booooooo lol not its coolll!!!!
5557	5	a	This page is good for day
5558	1	a	Mali mali naman ang mga tanong dito nakakainis paano matuto ang bata nyan..
5559	1	a	I like only Christian hip hop and they had Toby Mac but he isn't hip hop anymore (if he ever was) but I'll give 5 stars if you get lecrae, trip lee, canon, cross movement, dre da flame, but if you have none of that, I don't really like it.
5560	1	a	다른 어플에 비해 상당히 먼거리에서 20센티미터 정도. 초점 맞춰야 인식하고 들어가네요. 어떻게 적립하긴 했는데 불편합니다
5561	2	a	Yang ini original apa tidak. Soalnya konten sejenis persis sama isinya
5562	4	a	It is a fantastic game, all I want is to customize the controls and have a \nmode to let you build a level. Otherwise it is a grate game, watching the \ndopey guys stumble around is funny and I love it. Ps. Sometimes the game \ncrashes if you are on the hidden level.
5563	5	a	Very addicting! I still haven't put my phone down to play. Haha I'm very determined to save the owls! Good way to pass the time also. It's like a better version of Flappy Bird
5564	1	a	"Displays fine on screen when I open it, but when I click on \set wallpaper\"" all I get is a white homescreen. Uninstalling as soon as I submit this review."""
5565	5	a	Gives you all the feeling of a puja pandal.
5566	4	a	Good time pass game to exercise your mental  speed.
5567	1	a	I used this app to set up recordings on my DVR.  It only sometimes worked, but was nice when it did.  Now it seems like this feature has been removed?!?  It is pretty much the only reason for having this app!  What the heck.  Why, oh why, would you purposely remove this!
5568	2	a	Can someone explain this game to me cause I don't get it and I don't think half the people do that play it
5569	5	a	This is good for blind users
5570	5	a	This game is fun and it works really well for me. But can the creators please make a panther simulator if there's not one already that you made.
5571	5	a	Good for any person interest in learning Spanish on any level
5572	2	a	New version won't let me make transfers for no reason
5573	2	a	My 9 year old can't even know how to play it's just hard for my kid to play \nit :(
5574	1	a	Lowered to 1 star for not giving a s#1t about constant crashes on Note 8. Unplayable so far. Graphical glitches and crashes a lot. Dev team does not respond. Only customer support but they have no idea if somebody is working on a fix and when it is going to be ready. Completely no response in these comments. Nobody cares?
5575	2	a	Great tool except when you turn Wi-Fi hotspot off Wi-Fi on the phone never turn on
5576	4	a	Great game, need's work on the control's, then maybe five star's.
5577	4	a	I like this book it is very helpful
5578	1	a	Installed on LG G4 Dual MM 6.0 but doesn't show any signs of working app... Disappointed!?
5579	2	a	Pessimo app. Não mostra posição real dos ônibus e não salva os faviritos. \nNão recomendo
5580	5	a	I suffer from insomnia, migraines, and anxiety pretty regularly. These apps have really helped!  I have tried other mediation and self -hypnosis apps, but Andrew Johnson has a soothing voice and useful visualizations that I have not found elsewhere. He walks you through the relaxation process, and the apps have a few useful custom features to shorten the time or use at night for bed. I have gotten quite a bit of use out of most of these apps!
5581	3	a	The vibration test is only good if you have a phone but a tablet then it doesn't vibrate which makes the final result false
5582	2	a	The results are never visible
5583	1	a	When we saved the form filled text is move around other lines and which makes our editing useless
5584	1	a	Lost all my achievements, including paid upgrades. Will not sync with my Google play login, keeps returning error saying I don't have internet connection. What a waste.
5585	5	a	Crazy its make me LOL

5595	5	a	Five star. Superb. I'm loved it.                                                Megamind
5596	5	a	Crocodile Sniper Shooter Hunt great work i like it so much
5597	3	a	The voice is killing me, I use another app to listen too sounds like a Robot is reading to me. I have been with this app a while, use it for church only. Would like one bible app. Please do something with the voice 😊. Thank you...
5598	5	a	Must buy! Great wallpaper that will catch your eye every time.
5599	5	a	Kids stay away from guns OK guntastic
5600	2	a	Does not start on Nexus 5 / Android 6.0
5601	1	a	It kept lagging my phone, it crashed my whole phone, no joke, I had to get off it and delete it... It may work for others, but not mine at all... 😠
5602	1	a	Unfortunately torch has stopped working if we try to start the torch on 4.4 android Micromax a190 running on stock Micromax os
5603	4	a	Great app. Using it with a lenovo tablet built into the dash. Few issue or improvements needed; - Does not always play music automatically when unit turns on. - When pressing play for the first time after startup, the music jumps a few times (using vlc) - Can you add option to put device to sleep when power disconnected? Im using a separate app for this which is not ideal (Cannot get tablet to do this as quick as i would like).  Addressing the above would make it the perfect car app.  Cheers, Matt
5604	1	a	This app sucks does not work
5605	2	a	Why does it continually ask for me to rate after I have already done so?

5610	1	a	Where is bheem. Kids really love bheem. Please make apps involving bheem character. It really helps children to learn and plz keep adds away. They can not understand them.
5611	5	a	Love it .total stress reliever. Set as live wallpaper really helps
5612	5	a	Finally found the game I played last year! Loved this so much! Just wondering what changed though, reply if you can or something lol
5613	5	a	This wallpaper is awesome.We can always worsship our sikh gurus.Thanks for making this app.
5614	5	a	It work perfect on my phone.But I find it funny how this average rating 4.1 while warlocks and titans are 4.0.well I guess hunter is favorite classes
5615	4	a	Awsome game but its a deblock version of mario.....but still cool

5618	5	a	May Allah bless you all tenfold,shield you all this Ramadan and give you peace
5619	1	a	I am giving this review 1 star due to Playstore insisting the game was installed onto my system when it's not even there... I have been asking Playstore about this since 2012 and I haven't heard anything... I think I will not be recommending anything from Playstore until the situation is rectified...
5620	5	a	Amazing. Only suggestion I have is maybe a Material 2 style
5621	5	a	Just about the best wallpaper app. I've ever got
5622	5	a	Add Multiplayer Option,Daily Reward/Mission,Btw I Downloaded This App Yesterday,This Morning I Found Out That I Have ONE THOUSAND t crystal,I Checked My Credit Card Vendor,But There Were No Purchase Made,Is It A Bug?
5623	5	a	its a good game for on the road or bus never gets old with brand new pic every time
5624	3	a	This app is good, but it doesn't fool my cat. I did the angry cat 4 and I expected her to look scared and puff up, but instead she looked at my tablet and looked annoyed. Too smart!
5625	3	a	But it takes too long time to be downloaded
5626	5	a	Puppys puppy puppys puppys puppys puppys!!!!!!!!!!!!

5630	2	a	"Was kinda cool but lost 3d effect due to losing that \sweet spot\"" with the tilt steering. Really needs option for a joystick type control to get that real 3d feel. Not really worth keeping. Uninstalled."""
5631	5	a	Love this!!! RETAINS FORMATTING. I clip a LOT of recipes and currently store most of them in Evernote. This app lets me copy one after another-WITHOUT STOPPING- until I've reviewed all that are either interesting or relevant to my search. I stopped copying directly into Evernote because I then had to spend a lot of time formatting and cleaning it up. My only complaint is that I don't know how to move the Bubble around. It does change positions but I never know why. It isn't visually intrusive since I have it set to transparent. BUT it's in the way and, depending on position, will open when you are trying to do something else.
5632	2	a	"Stupid app. Ugly clocks. Have to \get points\"" to add designs by downloading unnecessary apps??.."""
5633	5	a	Very nice game. I m enjoying the driving but sometimes the game got hang
5634	5	a	The best looking analog.clock on the market. For those that says it doesn't open. Try reading it..its an add_on for the other widget.
5635	1	a	This a fake making that its not working but only that video like thating
5636	4	a	Its okay but I wouldn't say it go becuase it's slow but it does relax you mind a bit tho
5637	4	a	Good game to kill some time
5638	1	a	It is very boring . I am class 4 and I love bheem but still

5641	1	a	I cannot perform any function if the 2nd number is less than 1. Example: \n95x.05 shows in the display as 95.05 and if i hit \u003d the answer is 0. But it \nwill work if .05 is the first number. What other mistakes does this \ncalculator make that we dont know about????? Dump the app and go buy a TI30 \nxa
5642	5	a	Great game,  I'm on pro mode now which is great with top players!  Ads suck but can play offline to stop that!  Agree with some comments as for updates,  hawkeye, multi-player,  more outfits etc,  volley controls could be better. Just some suggestions otherwise this game is quality
5643	1	a	Can't hide the incoming commands such as SENDCALLLOG. If these commands are in stealth mode it was perfect. Hope it will be solved soon.
5644	1	a	Absolutely love the game but the ads are now on the screen instead of flashing up and being able to get out of them and they cover up some of the bridges so you can't play it anymore
5645	1	a	Just doesn't work well in many different ways.
5646	5	a	This is perfect for my son when we are out in the community!
5647	4	a	As a exotic i'll give you 5 star for that it's really nice that i found out that the dodol launcher have a exo theme:)
5648	5	a	This is the app that I needed to crop photos.
5649	2	a	Very bad game not working after level 35.(time  waste)
5650	5	a	It's very fun and challenging
5651	4	a	I love this app it's fun killing bugs to level up.
5652	5	a	My favorite game since tetris
5653	5	a	It's wow. Really accurate. This is the best application I found in heart \nrate monitoring. Thank you
5654	1	a	Only the upper left part of the wallpaper is moving in the free version. The rest is just a static pic to force you to pay for the full version. Uninstalled immediately.

5666	1	a	There is NO solving that stupid cube puzzle. I set all the dots to red and it makes me start all over
5667	5	a	Easy to learn, but still challenging. Love that you can play relaxed mode with no timer,more enjoyable! 😉
5668	5	a	I wanted to keep the stock icons and this plug-in does exactly that. You can also use other icons but not what I was interested in.
5669	5	a	So far so good I say its the 2nd best basketball game all these boobooo flick games im like what the heck\tNice game
5670	3	a	I love being able to access all of the content this app contains. However, I have to restart it constantly. The main problem I have is selecting a thread and it takes me to the last page or end without being able to navigate back. Once I restart, problem solved until it does it again. Galaxy S5
5671	5	a	Sad to see this app isn't working well for everyone, but I found it very easy to use and it's a great app to check your crunching status.
5672	1	a	It's really boring all you do is chase
5673	5	a	I'm so lucky for that I find out this app so soon.it's really lovely app \nmore than I thought.but this app is not helpful for Bangladeshi, bcoz it's \nnot show Bangladeshi number's location.it's helpful for India,Pakistan etc \ncountries,

5678	2	a	Gli autobus continuano a saltare le corse, la app non si apre nemmeno e intanto i biglietti si aumentano non di poco. Servizio ATAF pessimo in completo.
5679	2	a	After each crash you're stuck watching an ad for 30 seconds. Not fun. Spend more time cruising other games than playing this one.
5680	5	a	Just one word to describe this ang its awesome!!!!
5681	3	a	It was good but the small faced one is bad
5682	5	a	Nice game for time pass 😀

5692	4	a	Please tell how to enable map dude im having problem pls tell if u tell i will give five stars pls add more speed the truck is way too slow
5693	5	a	Wow!! this app let's you control your budget, see expanses and incomes in a great intuitive way. Most important I can add my significant other without paying like other annoying apps.
5694	5	a	" this app really helps.  Hope the developers work on it more and give us full keyboard support (with F1-12 keys) and possibly more functionality and features.  Still it's a lifesaver."""
5695	1	a	The graphics were chessey and it was very hard to play
5696	3	a	I've got a brand new phone and this game crashes all the time. If fixed it would be a good game.

Not sure how this is happening lol. It's cute but very strange

5706	3	a	It's a good app, but for certain introductions, you have to unlock (pay) or download another picture/video app. I like it but the free things aren't that great -.-
5707	1	a	I was waiting very patiently until this game downloaded and I can't play it. Please fix!
5708	1	a	This app is like the worst of the lot doesnt even load the pictures you cant do jack
5709	2	a	Jo lenne, ha internet kapcsolat nelkul is elindulna, hogy tudjam a megvasarolt jegyet megmutatni a kalauznak akkor is, ha epp nincs mobil net lefedettseg az adott szakaszon. Nem tudom offline megmutatni a letoltott jegyet, mert net kapcsolat nelkul nem indul az app.

5718	5	a	I love these games it keep my mine sharp
5719	1	a	Your app is trash. On the occasional days that it actually functions and lets me access my account, it crashes at about a 50/50 rate. Loading screens are arbitrarily long for no good reason and the GUI is abysmal. Hire a better app dev team.
5720	5	a	Wow just an incredible app, best £2 I've spent on the play store, graphics \nis stunning, Wish there was a day and night cycle so Europe can be in \ndaylight though. And maybe to orbit the moon and look at earth from there \nwould be great. Other than that I can't fault it.
5721	1	a	- and useless. Can't even uninstall it. I thought this was my phone??

5726	1	a	I tried to get it for my sisster but it just turn off
5727	1	a	It doesn't even work! It is useless!!!!!
5728	1	a	I drove onto the sidewalk by mistake and my car started to fall thru the ground and then it made it look like i was floating in the sky. The car stopped moving and i was stuck. I do not recommend this game to anyone because it is a waste of time. They need to work out alot more features in the game and fix the glitches.
5729	5	a	Its not much to it. Pick corresponding note and increase your knowledge. Its helpful.
5730	2	a	Not working on Nokia 6
5731	5	a	Molto bello! Ma vorrei scoprire il trucco.. :)
5732	4	a	It would be better with more cars and more maps
5733	1	a	Freaking soldiers suck so bad they won't listen to commands and always get killed
5734	1	a	Where there be an update or modification in order for people like me who have a windows phone so we can download it too
5735	2	a	I'm going to be blunt. I know this is an old game an probably has been abandoned since, but no amout of update can fix these problems. At it's core, this game is basically Cyber Kights, but with all the things that made that game enjoyable replaced with all the things that made Star Traders frustrating. The encounters and events are not only far too common, the ship stops after each one. The available regions are arbitrary and the factions are unbalanced, but worse yet, the elite only areas still exist, and stuff still happens there, i just can't visit them. Aside from the map, there's not always a clear indication of what's elite only and what isn't, with some features seemingly missing entirely. Rumors and conflicts go by far too fast, before i have a chance to benefit from them, and some are irrelevant because they're outside playable areas while others seem to be bogus entirely or refer to elite exclusive events, but there's no clear indication if that is the case or not. Not to mention the story itself is stupid, the main character is dislikeable and unsympathetic, and i simply don't care what direction it goes in because i can't get invested. Which can be said about the rest of the game. I'm just sticking to the other two sandbox games, as opposed to the one that tries to be both and fails miserably. Sorry
5736	1	a	For some reason your app which was working brilliant asked for a phone update and app update. Well since doing them both app now says it won't work because you have a new update. It was working fine .so what has happened in last week. And I've saw u told others it now users update 5.0.1 my adroid Samsung galaxy g4 is now using that update plus your new update and I've deleted and reinstalled. Makes no difference as it says u have a new update app coming soon. .so all my system is compatible yet still nothing.
5737	5	a	This is the best app I've found. Other than a dictionary, there is no need for other Hangul learning tools! Thank you
5738	1	a	Quality wise its terrible,  game-play wise its even worse.

5740	2	a	I was playing this awesome game,but when I got to level 12 on the ice cold land,the game said that I needed to either unlock or get the full version!!!!🙅😼😾😿👾👿👹👊👊👎👎❎❌✖✖👅😎😎😞😭😭😭😭😭
5741	5	a	easy for reviewing my vocab.
5742	5	a	The gameplay is simple, but the sound effect and graphic make it more interesting in a funny way
5743	5	a	I have had this for a while and felt compelled to write a review and tell you all it's an amazing deal. You get an entire library of very high quality hypnosis/suggestion audios, on many different topics (areas to focus on). Self hypnosis is very effective when used on a regular basis. I can attest to this personally. I find myself choosing the Joseph Clough audios over any others that I have access to, including Law of Attraction. You won't regret buying this unless you just fail to use it.
5744	4	a	This game is great but the models seem a little old. The styles are good but a little out of date. This game needs an update
5745	1	a	Does not work. It won't  connect to PlayStation without crashing. And btw I'm not an idiot I don't think this is the full game. It is supposed to be a companion so but instead it is garbage, that doesn't run, and those who say otherwise are lying developers.
5746	5	a	I learn kankathara manthiram via this app.learning mode,slow chanting.very nice sir.pls upload more...
5747	3	a	I think it should come with more color and iterations...good app but not much fun..you can get this info from other apps with pictures and videos and much more..
5748	5	a	Wat A  game......nce graphic:-)
5749	4	a	Only problem I have is it hangs once you combine two 8192 tiles.
5750	5	a	Defenity a awesome game COOL
5751	4	a	"I really like this app however I do have one complaint... Sometimes the items I list are long and once that happens the \Edit\"" feature is no longer on the screen and I can no longer edit the items on my list.  There should be a way to scroll to the right to be able to edit items. Other than that I use this app all the time."""
5752	3	a	Worth d-loading and seeing for your self. Good shooting game.
5753	5	a	I like garbage truck games like this one because there cool
5754	4	a	display 12hr time and include delta from phone
5755	4	a	Doesn't play nice with 1:1 photos. Please make it compatible with 1:1 sources!
5756	4	a	very good app, but poor graphics and poor BACK Button... need more improvement...
5757	5	a	Its a really fun game and its a little challenging
5758	5	a	I love this game a lot what ever hilarious questions I am asking she is giving me
5759	4	a	I have a question can ubplay of line as well?
5760	4	a	Great App. Could use some accuracy improvements, though. AAxAA pre-flop have about 95.5% chance of drawing; winning chance is equal to both players.

5762	4	a	Great app, easyvto use, attractive and very helpful for tracking my cycle. HOWEVER lost all my data when changed my phone and now a year's data is lost exactly when I most need it. Have used backup process b changed phone but when restored showed empty calendar. Really need help to restore so would be grateful if you could get back to me please for extra star 😃 Thanks
5763	5	a	i love this theme!it suits my personality
5764	5	a	I love it so much fun impossible to loss. All you got a do is draw lines from side to side if the ball is to big to drop down further just scribble all around it till it glitches through the lines and then carry on. GREAT
5765	4	a	Ads can occasionally be a bit annoying, probably my mood tho. Has Bringe's unique take on controls, which I really like in a cpl of their other apps, but in this app they seem to be lacking considerably in options. Simple has its place tho ...  my main issue, really, is that you can't shoot a mirrored shot from the cam. 3 1/2 stars would be more accurate, but I'll be nice and round up in absence of a slightly more detailed rating system 😐
5766	1	a	I had this game download before and I'm trying to log into my Facebook but \nit won't let me. I would like to continue where I left off and keep my \nfriends and level I was on I was also vip. I don't know how to get back to \nmy original account. Please help me. Thank you.
5767	4	a	It is a good endless runner although it just goes by too fast, I was able to unlock all the stages after a few minutes of playing, what I suggest is add a few collectables like water as the special currency  being randomly encountered  and hard to get or pay to get and canned food being the Normal currency of the game that also be paid to get. also add different unlockables like weapons and costumes. One thing that bugs me, I would prefer the character to move holding the bat on his shoulder
5768	4	a	Great app, May Allah rewards you
5769	4	a	I've never given an app review but I really liked this app. PLEASE update! I love the game but sometimes emails are impossible to read due to glitches. Update and you'll have 5 stars.
5770	3	a	Brilliant game but every time an ad pops up it closes the app.
5771	5	a	We all have our favorite places to hit where we know we will get the hookups but this app allows us to try new spots and a variety of other services/businesses that we in the industry never thought we could get hook ups on \u0026 its for all 7 days of the week just for IndiCard members only!!! The fact that I can also use my IndiCard in multiple IndiCard cities is AMAZZZZZING!!! DENVER, Chicago, Vegas.....can't wait for more major cities to come!!!!
5772	5	a	" you make my life \neasier!!!!!!!😘"""
5773	5	a	I play sudoku almost everyday!  This is a great, simple, app. Thanks!

5775	4	a	This will make French stick with you in such a friendly manner. Love it
5776	5	a	Best so far .Great Intetface
5777	2	a	"Before it was good. Now it's crap. Finish the full append get rid of this \lite\"" version.  Also I'm uninstalling because of the intrusive ads. The ones that pop up from the bottom taking 1/3rd of the screen and the ones that automatically take the user to the play store."""
5778	1	a	The game is dumb retarded and have no taste
5779	5	a	Great app.Will consider getting pro-version next year.
5780	1	a	Title is different and when u open it u will see something else. Thats sucks😛
5781	1	a	It is fun at the start afterwards  my child hates it and calls it stupid so DON'T GET THE APP
5782	2	a	The news provided aren't up to date. Are you serious!!
5783	5	a	Like the wild card action in the free spins mode u get lucky u can really rack up the points the trick is holding on to them
5784	4	a	This is a fun game!!!!!
5785	1	a	I couldnt make a move but the android could
5786	1	a	I wrote my family's birthdays down then all of them got deleted then my whole entire family got mad at me because I forgot there birthdays.  So people that r wanting to download this apology dont because then all of ur family will hate u
5787	5	a	I'll forgive you because this game is awesome
5788	1	a	After I bought the game it started to glitch and screw up couldn't finish
5789	5	a	It's great but sometimes challenging and I get stuck for a few hours but overall it's fun
5790	4	a	เป็น app ที่มีประโยชน์ ข้อมูลเยอะ แต่ต้องใช้เวลาโหลดนิดนึง ถ้าอินเตอร์เน็ตช้า ก็โหลดนานเลย
5791	5	a	The new version is perfect! By far the best gear deal app I've tried. Tons of features. Great job!
5792	2	a	Esta app está haciendo que Android reporte exceso de uso de batería y en \nefecto así lo es por lo que tuve que desinstalarla, el widget me gusta \nmucho y es útil pero en optimización les va mal, espero que mejore para \nvolverla a instalar
5793	4	a	Wow! This dictionary very interesting.
5794	5	a	This is the best game
5795	3	a	Will not load on the samsung tab 3. Works on my Note 4, but has recently started glitching as well as on the ipad
5796	1	a	This is wastage of time ;I never want to play this game ever again
5797	3	a	You have to buy EVERYTHING!!! So 15$ to get everything for this App is insane ;( other then that it would be a nice game :(
5798	5	a	Just too good for the job. I like it
5799	1	a	Keeps my 2 yr old busy
5800	5	a	It it good. It also could be a good pranking app
5801	4	a	I've Tried many switcher apps. Previously switchr was the favourite but on O the side bar crashed. Switched to meteor , very please and surprised. Aethesically it's very pleasing sticking to material look. Everything works excellent and the fact you can add folders is brilliant. One issue I have though is when a keyboard is launched the the app goes behind the keyboard and can't be used on the lower half without closing the keyboard.  Maybe you could make the side bar sit on top of the keyboard therefore not interfering whenever you finish typing But need to switch apps?
5802	5	a	perfact game for full timepass...
5803	5	a	Just started to use this app, its so easy and no adds too, its got good \nsettings, simple layout, brilliant!
5804	5	a	It's free and it works perfectly what more could anyone ask for? My driod X has been unleashed thank you!! ^_^
5805	5	a	This is by far the most versatile software out here.  Being someone who cant sit down and focus long on one thing, its nice to have something that I can actually finish.  Thank you for helping me, a 30 year old semi-successful man, finally be able to enjoy a whole book!!!
5806	3	a	Has some good info about mother and baby. Due date link never works and the pictures of the baby are alittle scary looking.
5807	3	a	The free offers won't always open and there seems to be no way to open a lot of the features without spending actual money. I downloaded this for my niece and it was okay for a few minutes. Then, when she could see all the pretty stuff that she couldn't play with, not so much fun. Needs work.
5808	1	a	Udmærkede eksempler, nemt at forstå. Kanon - håber på flere eksempler.
5809	5	a	I can listen to it for hours and the end is so cool and u don't need wifi
5810	5	a	Fast hence saves time love it.... Go for it
5811	1	a	Unable to downlod.... Its been stucked... Bullshit
5812	1	a	Can't login with Galaxy S8
5813	5	a	Different than the original and more fun.  Thank you.
5814	5	a	This really is the best Sudoku app not just for playing, but also learning. 'Hints' are top notch and also teach. Finally after a few years I bought full version.
5815	5	a	i want to upgrade all weapon
5816	5	a	Awesome and much more accurate than our weathermen !!!
5817	1	a	Utter Waste crappy aps..full of ads uninstalled within 2 minutes... don't waste you data and time here

5820	5	a	Very very beautiful desigens in this app.download it.
5821	1	a	I have it on my iPod, works fine there but not on my Android phone \u003d\\
5822	5	a	gave a great suggestion on how to stop them from biting us while playing
5823	3	a	No track #, no disc # in the tags. Why not have all tags available? There is no way to manually rename the file as desired once you know what it is, or auto rename it by drop down settings - as in :
5824	5	a	Helps block the ringing in my ears
5825	4	a	Good game, quite challenging and good artwork. Found this app on a Great Reward App named Giftiz. Referral code : JNBGY2
5826	5	a	Love that it wont take random pictures with your camera like most of the other ones!!!  That's something you have to watch out for..
5827	4	a	It will not download all the files, could it not be NVIDIA Shield friendly.  Still it looks great
5828	4	a	But it needs for war feature and to be able to broadcast to chromecast edit fog of war is there,  ideal for playing in your front room not so sure about online games
5829	5	a	So much features and protocols, you can basically control everything. Don't listen to all retards that doesn't understand how to use it, you'll need some computer knowledge as you have to run a server for it.
5830	5	a	Cannot access menu with new Motorola droid mini.

5835	1	a	Parallel apps are not showing up in my oneplus now, previously it was working fine. Backup feature also not working properly, it didn't restore after reinstalling the app. Used to love this app now i hate like anything
5836	4	a	This is usually one of my 5 star apps. But since I upgraded my device to kitkat, I cannot use simple copy paste anymore. Please fix it, and it'll be back to 5 stars. Thx
5837	3	a	You really annoyed me how u took out a lot of the cars from the game which were good cars. First of all your portraying the game to be the same when it's clearly not before you added these new features. I don't like how there was range of cars that looked good in the trailer but they wasn't there in the real game. I'm not saying I don't like the new cars because do but I don't like how you took out all of those cars for nothing.
5838	1	a	Its dont even show me where to register at why get the app if i cant register to My get the info
5839	5	a	Bloody good. Gotta put in the effort and then: bingo! Updates please! Cheers!

5848	1	a	Every time I try to play it, it goes back to the home screen. Fix it plz
5849	5	a	Finally a great solution for stuffing that ugly tvboks in cupboard.  I've been using their other. (recording) app for a few months now and I use it every day to plan my TV evening.  Keep em coming Telia!

5858	5	a	Very fun puzzle game, passes the time.
5859	4	a	It's very good for baby
5860	4	a	I can only give it a 4 because nothing is named like you get a photo of a galaxy but without it being named you have no idea what galaxy you are looking at. So please add names to the object's that are photographed.
5861	5	a	So. for real. This is perfect. One question. I get the Triangke caution mark next to the speaker icon on the right. What does it mean? It works but always caution. Great app. emf and the noise maker. Good as Gold..
5862	1	a	Get rid of the ads!
5863	2	a	Another app that fail in the image resolution department... Once uploaded to Instagram, image loses a lot of resolution quality... It does its job as far as squaring picture... Fix poor image quality to Instagram... Uninstalling for now
5864	5	a	I liked it a lot hopefully my phone don't crash again
5865	2	a	For anyone with basic English skills the words are far to basic. I couldn't find one I didn't already know. Should be an option for difficulty or how commonplace words are. Un installed because there is no benefit.

5869	1	a	I want a refund bought it to have full version of PDA + but dosnt work
5870	1	a	They CLAIM if this app can't take a screenshot, NONE CAN.  This app has FAILED to take any screenshots with all the various methods they provide/suggest, but   I CAN TAKE SCREENSHOTS WITHOUT FAIL AND SILENTLY with any number of (video game) emulator apps!!!  How can a video game work not much bigger than this one flawlessly recreate nintendo systems AND take screenshots at the bat of an eyelash but a DEDICATED screenshot app can't get it right???  Gonna try a few things to get this to work....
5871	2	a	Adds pop up every few minuets.
5872	4	a	I have only done 3 puzzles so far, but I think I will love it, once  I,  really, get into it.. I  love puzzles and games that make  me use my brain. I  am 65, and working on my 2nd Master's Degree, so I need to do everything I can to keep my brain as sharp as I can.
5873	5	a	I can use this app in many ways not related to golf,  but what I really like is the ability to plan club strategy on various golf courses while at home.   scroll the map to the golf course location,  tap the tee box,  and then  tap the place you want the ball.  I never had time in the middle of a round,  but this is easy.
5874	5	a	אפילו הוטמובייל עצמם לא הצליחו להגדיר את האינטרנט ועם האפליקציה הצלחתי במהירות
5875	4	a	I liked it. It's really short, though. I would play this for a long time if there were a lot more upgrades.
5876	1	a	There are an overwhelming number of ads popping up that there was no way not to accidentally press on one.
5877	4	a	Works ok on my Galaxy S5.  For some train contracts, only a code number is shown, but origin and destination stations are not identified. This information should be added if possible. If not possible, how about a link to a website where the codes are identified.

5882	4	a	Awsome!! Just its WAYYYYY to hard. I am stuck on night 4! Oh and also its better on PC cause it has the secret minigames but, in the Android version of FNAF3 the secret minigames are at the end of the night. But it is for the sake of android anyway so i do not really care. I just wanted to say thankyou for Five Nights at Freddy's. Good game. Good franchise
5883	1	a	Poor control, awful graphics and quite boring.
5884	3	a	Game is nice, but would be better with offline play. When data is turned off, the game won't start, it has to be connected to Google to run.
5885	5	a	Pls add username and password
5886	1	a	SO STUPID! I can not get the two people to have a baby! They either embrace or argue because they don't think it's time to have a baby!Virtual Families 2 is way way way way WAY more fun and I think everybody should delete Virtual Families Lite and download Virtual Families 2! And I hope you all do!
5887	5	a	Thus time is awesome and it's included for VIP Go sms users. You pay 19.99 ONCE and you have access to thousands and thousands of sms themes forever, this one included! Please don't one star because you didn't read the details in the app description saying that it's free to download  (which it is!) But not free to apply unless etc. It's just that simple people!
5888	1	a	All of a sudden it will not let me login and keeps saying my username is invalid.
5889	4	a	It's really good actually. Are you only allowed up to a certain lvl though? I'm just wondering. So far I have up to 2 family members. Me and my brother call it a family member XD Except sometimes when I control my flight it just stops right in the middle. And right in the middle when I'm hunting! XD But yeah. WAIT... I WANTED TO SAYYYY SOMETHING. How can they hunt wolves? And goats? DEERS?   XD Let me just tell you I have never seen or heard of an owl hunting or eating wolves, goats, deers, and also maybe even other things too! Heheh. I mean, I understand rabbits and I get. Yeah, ducks somewhat too. But those other things?? Man, I would die if I had to hunt those things and I was only a little owl! XD

5898	4	a	This is very simple and helpful...  Im giving 4 stars because i think it need more analysis tools, like a missing by category filter, missing holograms filter, etc.  Also having another function to not add or remove information because when drilling-down, i'm adding or substracting stickers.  I've tried lots of sticker album apps and this is the best!!! but i know it can be better
5899	4	a	Fun if you like this type of thing. Too stressful for me. And the music! It's the same music box version of Silent Night, over and over. Horrifying.

5907	4	a	Addictive. I don't know if it strengthens my memory but, it's a good way of passing time on my break at work.
5908	3	a	Wild Pitches equal automatic runs in this game. The ball goes through the unprogramed backstop and the catcher starts a run to Centerfield.  Atrocious.
5909	4	a	Easy way for early learners,loud  sound n big n clear words
5910	5	a	Customization options are superb. Easy to use. Easy to customize and plenty of themes. Love it. My only complaint is not being able to label folders like you can with stock jelly bean. If there's a way to implement folder naming or labeling, that would make this the perfect launcher!
5911	4	a	I think it's very difficult and good level and a belt is very important
5912	5	a	Best play game for kids
5913	1	a	It keeps force closing every single time I open the app ugh
5914	1	a	Stuck at authentication :( :(
5915	5	a	This is best for people who love balasaheb.
5916	4	a	How do I change difficulties. When I first started the game I selected \nbeginner, now I want to play a harder difficulty but it won't let me change \nthe mode how do I do that.
5917	1	a	Unless ur willing to click no to advertisements every 2 sec. Pop ups are up every time, i almost destroyed my phone. There are plenty of other better games. Dont download this one. And the bubble does not even go where I originally aimed. This is the worst game ive played in my life. Uninstalling, and never want to play anything from the same maker. Thanks.
5918	5	a	In this newest game, you play as a man who must JUMP to save his own life. Taking advantage of all the latest technology, be prepared to take on intense graphics and breathtaking action scenes. With touch control and progressive gameplay, you can be sure this is a game that you will not be able to put down!

5923	3	a	Some of them or most of them are hard to do. Because those nail were did by professionals
5924	1	a	It sucks me a lot does'nt work
5925	2	a	First of all, i take that as offensive because im half Korean, but fyi, the language is JAPANESE, so if you dont know the difference, dont say crap at all, and dont call it stupid

5929	5	a	Informasi sgt baik tdk mmihak pd kebathilan... Semangat trus tim redaksi...
5930	1	a	Only for free points I had downloaded this stupid game.
5931	2	a	I have not been able to play since April when the last update was. Please fix the game. Think about it, you fix it and that would bring more money in by all the purchase's in the game. Please fix.
5932	3	a	I'd like to see a calendar feature or some easy way for me to look back to see when I did what.
5933	5	a	In love with all the cute ways it shows the apps. Wish some of the apps would change too.
5934	4	a	"calculate  BMI with no \special permissions\"" needed"""
5935	5	a	I like very much this apps
5936	4	a	Looks good But controls need work... Not fun to play, It can be fun if you want to tilt control a boat.
5937	4	a	I would give it 5, but my only complaint is how the left bass drum sounds slightly higher than the other. Fix that and 5 stars it is! Also i hate how the drumstick goes haywire.
5938	4	a	Just want to say... thank you for the update. Hope you could add 10-ball or \nmore games. Over all this game is very good.
5939	5	a	Kellene már egy új verzió
5940	4	a	I like this game.   One I couldn't get, came to me after I put the game down.  I just don't like it being timed
5941	1	a	I paid for it and now they want me to pay again!
5942	1	a	My full version became a demo after upgrade-Uninstalled
5943	4	a	The game is good and all but there is always ads after playing the game it's boring and if it's possible can u add a daily reward. U should try and put a 10 strikes whereby if u have 10 strikes the cops and swat call for beckup from soilders which will apper from the swat vans (at the beck of the car) shooting at us
5944	3	a	There's no way to find the themes I have paid for in the past.
5945	2	a	You only get to play.20 levels which r easy. then u have to spend ur money to pay for a key to unlock ths rest
5946	1	a	😞 don't know how to use it
5947	5	a	Looks nice and isn't a mess to navigate
5948	1	a	"Right from the start they pronounce \A\"" like \""aye\"" - uninstalled"""
5949	1	a	"I remember having this game on iOS a few years back, and I loved it. I got really excited that it was in the Play store, and downloaded it right away. However, after it starts up, I hit \play\"" and it immediately crashes. I've redownloaded it several times with the same effect."""
5950	2	a	My first freebie from App of the day and boy am I glad it was free. £4 plus for a boring unchallenging repetative game would have been scandalous. Uninstalled.
5951	3	a	Özetler gayet iyi yararlı anlaşılır.ama yazım hatalı baya çok o hariç iyi şu an da bir açılmama sorunu oldu silip yüklüyorum düzelirse iyi olur emeğe sağlık

5953	4	a	Awesome game put needs longer life
5954	1	a	3rd level .. i hate this app  very tough levels i dont know who the mental one has maden it
5955	5	a	I love that the Peak app is so simple. Stream or stop. No need for extra bells and whistles. Works great.
5956	5	a	this game is just like the regular find the differences game. its fun and addicting
5957	5	a	This is a great theme
5958	1	a	Colours are very dark. All are looking same. No new design is there.
5959	5	a	I like the variable difficulty levels. I can choose a small puzzle if I don't have much time. The Huge / Difficult was exactly that. Good words and good fun.
5960	1	a	It don't work at all. It's  horrible af. They need to make this better if they want it to be popular cause right now it ain't working. Straight like that
5961	2	a	I didnt use it yet. Because it is still installing. And its quite slow
5962	5	a	Seriously, Dawat e Islami is one of the truest islamic party and their apps are too helpful for the foreign Muslims where there's no Faizan e  Madina near
5963	3	a	Thank you for the best app.

5965	2	a	My only suggestions would be to allow us to decline goals that involve downloading games I don't want to download. After all, I only have so much space on my device and gems don't mean that much to me. Secondly, what's with having to download an entirely new game (an extra 20-odd Mb of space) for a new theme (e.g. Spring, Valentine's, etc.)?! Why not just update the original game? I don't have the space to keep downloading a new version of the game each time there is a theme. Smh fix for positive rating.
5966	1	a	Doesn't work. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!! Sprint LG.
5967	5	a	Wish we could do that too our own photos , love this app still
5968	4	a	My 3.5 year old loves the games in the app. The great thing is he is learning Mandarin too!
5969	5	a	Its no surprise this game is amazing, theres a small downside which is the lack of creativity
5970	5	a	May ALLAH bless you ya akhi
5971	4	a	The one star missing is when I wrongly press the setting or restart button, it interrupted my blitz game. If you can do something about it, my 5star is yours!!
5972	1	a	QC MAIL! The whole  app is collectively pointless without it.
5973	4	a	چی جوری روگوشیم اعمال کنم
5974	2	a	The app does work but there is a delay in showing the lock screen.  When I shake my device it goes to my home screen then 3-4 seconds later the lock screen shows!  How can I avoid this without deactivating the lock screen.  It would be ok if there was no delay and the lock screen was shown after shaking.  With the delay it takes the same amount of time to get to my home screen witch make this app kind of redundant.
5975	2	a	What does this have to do with hula???
5976	4	a	I liked this app! Had a great selection of ringtones and notifications! \nWould've liked to see more, and it didn't have many ads, it's bearable. \nAlso, the app seemed pretty easy to navigate, I enjoyed the sounds \navailable!
5977	5	a	The app works perfectly, if you have the right phone to use it with. I've been using it for years with the tether feature only but recently I got a phone that can take advantage of all the features this app has to offer. In conclusion, this app does work as advertised, just not on all devices. And also prolonged use can make your phone heat up so watch out for that.
5978	5	a	The predictions are accurate. It matches every day. I had not any believe in astrology. But after using this app I become a fan of it. Every day I checked it and become surprise to find the accurate match.
5979	4	a	Panel list not found(on pc all is fine)
5980	1	a	Hated it it was boring and no reset button
5981	2	a	Graphics and voice acting are pretty bad... upgrades are way too expensive, u cant even effort to upgrade anything at all in the beginning.. map sticks to the same until u manage to unlock new area. Music gets kinda annoying after awhile.. would be a fun game if theres improvements. Else its just a game that wont catch audience interest.
5982	4	a	Tks, it's good. But i can't move item
5983	3	a	Good game when it is not closing itself or freezing. And either orb deliverery is reallt you or they just like taking your money.
5984	5	a	Don't give it a break. Keep the practice regular. It's fun!
5985	5	a	My granddaughter and I really enjoy this game it shows a lot of skills which is really good for her she's only two years old but she does really good it's totally awesome we love it
5986	5	a	It' s very interesting. It is'nt too difficult so it make me excited and I have had relaxing time. :)
5987	5	a	Purple is my favorite color and this theme is really perfect for me. Not too girly. The font is simple and easy to read. Easy to distinguish. Not too girly. Recommended! :)
5988	2	a	Doesnt work on mtk6577, crashes after loading a map..
5989	5	a	I'm too super mlg for this...+420...😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
5990	2	a	I paid the combo and yet they want me to pay more for this? If I've known it, I wouldn't have paid for both premium. Don't fall for their tricks. Love the app but hate how they're greedy for more $. Change it and I'll bump up to 5 stars.
5991	5	a	I love my phone more because of this!
5992	5	a	I like the challenge of finding the objects!
5993	5	a	WONDERFUL!   MAY GOD BLESS YOU!  THANK YOU!     K CATHER
5994	4	a	It should be able to play songs automatically through song list not just the play all feature  and i was getting a hige amount of lag for a anemation i download in 720p and even 1040p the lag is worst please fix but from 420p there is no lag tho
5995	5	a	I have installed this app in Google Nexus 6P which has finger print sensor as well. But this app does not have functionality to enable fingerprint for Nexus 6P whereas this functionality only works with Samsung phone. I am using android 8.1.0 and security patch level is Dec, 5 2018. Can someone please add finger print sensor for Google Nexus 6P (Huawei) Thanks, Javed
5996	5	a	Simply Stunning Learning an immense amount and loving the glorious graphics. Thank you so much to the development team.
5997	1	a	Y'all ain't making me mad this is the supid app ever
5998	4	a	Please update, time and date of all, it will help us remember..
5999	5	a	I wish you guys added some more recipes.. but overall - Awesome!
6000	5	a	i love to play its more levels guyz.. yo :-D
6001	4	a	I love it, but it does freeze up and stop working of ten so that I have to reopen the game. Please fix this!
6002	5	a	love these jokes too mch...
6003	1	a	It didn't even meet half of my expectation!
6004	2	a	"App has very intrusive ads that constantly popup especially an ad that will open my browser and says \Update your phones security\"" while making it vibrate until the window is closed. Downloading images is kind of a chore when you choose to download it will open a browser with a few blank pages or tabs and after a few moments it will finally download the image."""
6005	1	a	Currently using Xiaomi MI 8 and the game crashed when downloading files \nafter install.
6006	4	a	I have enjoyed playing this particular game. It has been easy to advance and never having to buy any gems in order to accomplish levels. It does require a lot of attention if you plan to level up because some things have time limits. Overall I would recommend ya to download and ta' have fun..especially if ya like to cook.
6007	2	a	Sämsta skiten av alla, fungerar akdrig när man väl behöber den!! Hur svårt kan det vara att göra en stabil tjänst?
6008	1	a	You must be mad too many ads every Two secs very annoying
6009	5	a	best solo launcher theme I've seen...simply classy
6010	4	a	Excellent but I can't download the videos
6011	4	a	Excellent game but most advertising remains after paying to remove ads.  Company doesn't remove ads for its own games that block menus and delay start up.  Game itself has great balance between developing houses and improvements.
6012	1	a	R U kidding, where's English!?
6013	5	a	A very well programmed app. Test the gyroscope , compass and more. This is a great tool.!
6014	5	a	Excellent programable click track for music practice.
6015	5	a	It's the best game I have ever seen and it can be downloaded very easily   😎😎😎😎😎
6016	4	a	It's a nice app but I was hoping it would have the Divine Mercy Chaplet in \nsong which unfortunately it doesn't have.
6017	1	a	Bakwaas game ,its not working at all,please don't make such type of bullshit
6018	1	a	The user interface is none existent. It gets no Stars from me.
6019	5	a	Although many radio stations do not work, Radio programas del Peru works great.
6020	1	a	Tried it and it didn't come to life. Nothing happened.
6021	4	a	It was hard to learn the contols, but once I did it was RTS and resource management.
6022	5	a	Could be penalties for WRONG punch and time limiting or points for fast finish Maybe dif game
6023	5	a	Its a good game but for some reason it won't let me synchronize with \nFacebook to get my points n plus I cant access my original levels. I had to \nrestart from the first level n i did send the game a email for help with my \nissues. But got no response.
6024	2	a	Initially really nice, but fails to maintain consistency.
6025	5	a	but can you add some picture of natsu dragneel from fairy tail
6026	5	a	Just completely cool! Brilliant app! But I cannot play it at night xD so scary and cute !
6027	5	a	Killing man but steering problem with me
6028	3	a	Was fun enjoyed the different types of games
6029	5	a	Once I figured it out I'm addicted :)
6030	4	a	So far it's a sweet little game... Will update after I've played a while
6031	5	a	This spawned the funniest cab ride ever. Great sound effects. Hold phone vertical for idle - tip to cut.*THC Incredible
6032	1	a	Couldn't get it to anything!
6033	4	a	Pretty cool game, downloaded it for my kids and I play it just as much as they do
6034	5	a	Requires no permissions a game would not need.
6035	3	a	Very interesting, too many TV Channels from many countries, but many technical problems - too many interruptions of emissions. Too many interruptions of streamings. Please increase the speed of Internet from TV Channelsvia this application to have possibilities to watch TV without problems! Thank you!
6036	5	a	It's very useful! I liked
6037	5	a	Could you change the body color without a color potion?
6038	5	a	I want to play this game. I hope the game is gr8! :)
6039	4	a	Its a nice app. The only thing ive got a trouble is that i think its not updated. I cannot load someone with sim no. 0999, also , some of the LCAN do not respond that fast it takes more than 10 min. to load up someone.
6040	1	a	Worst app within SkyTeam. Now lost feature to display boarding pass after \ncheckin. Can you scan other apps how it should be designed, unfortunately I \nam forced to use CSA even trying hard to avoid when possible.
6041	2	a	This app does not state that it is only free for a few cycles.  After that you have to pay to continue.  Also if you accidentally put in the wrong date the calendar will no longer function correctly cause it will not remove the information from the chart.  Very annoying.  Also, no response when submitting questions.
6042	5	a	so far so good I kind of like it. I found out what an annoying alerts it has.
6043	4	a	" regardless of whether i have or not. Many times it will pop up 5 minutes after I sent out all of my scouts on long missions. Great app other than that!!"""
6044	1	a	$10.00 purchase the game reset and I lost it please fix
6045	3	a	This is a good app but it doesn't let me choose a time lower than a minute for my pictures to change (I needed an option like every 5/10/30 seconds) and it doesn't let me individually choose the pictures I want as my wallpaper (it's just let's me pick the folder but I don't need EVERYONE pic in that folder to be my wallpaper). PLZZZZ fix that, plz plz plz :'(
6046	5	a	When I saw the video of this for 4seconds I was like nope I'm not watching this anymore in downloading it now cuz It looks so epic!!!!!!
6047	1	a	La aplicación se detiene con mucha frecuencia
6048	4	a	One of the great app. Tnx Developers. You have mentioned in description that this can be used offline but this app doesn't work offline, it asks for Internet connection. Would be great if u make this possible to work offline.
6049	5	a	Helped me♡ to make sure my Warranty Status was still valid. TY
6050	5	a	Is my first time to use this app n I really enjoy it may Almighty Allah keep on blessing you n pls there some programs on it who is in Arabic try translate it in English for us.
6051	1	a	Teksnya kok gak ada ya
6052	3	a	I REALLY love this game, I will have to delete it you you'll don't fix the problem with the screen going diagonal. It's really annoying me!!!!!
6053	2	a	Don't download, wastes battery, constantly chargeing your phone, rubbish app, uninstalling now!!
6054	3	a	Quite a good twist on the game. An ad after every game is too much though
6055	3	a	Got to level 400, finished it, then got error msg and it wouldn't go passed 400. Had to reinstall which put me back to level 1.
6056	3	a	Cant make any people on level 26 needs to be fixed
6057	3	a	Ich wollte an sich nur das deutsche Dictionary, da ich grundsätzlich nur das us layout benutze. Schade dass man keine qwerty bei Auswahl Deutsch einstellen kann. Ich hab keine Lust mich jedes Mal umstellen zu mūssen. Somit für mich fast nutzlos.
6058	4	a	สนุก ความยากเพิ่มขึ้นไม่เร็วไป ไม่ช้าไป ด่าน(ยัง)ไม่ยากไป แต่ด่านมีเยอะมากกกก ประกอบกับไม่มีปลดล็อค achievement หรือ story เพิ่ม เลยรู้สึกเบื่อ  คนที่มีเวลาว่างเยอะๆ และอยากหาอะไรฆ่าเวลา น่าจะชอบเกมนี้ (ถ้าอนาคตมีอัพเดทอาจจะกลับมาเล่นต่อ)
6059	5	a	I love this application and I call on all Muslims to have it on their smartphones. It pays to use it only that one might not know now. May Allah reward whoever had a hand in the production of the app with Jannatil Firdaus, amen.
6060	5	a	I really like it but make it so android is compatible with iOS I really want to play with my brother
6061	5	a	My 2 yo grandson loves it! if he's happy I'm happy
6062	5	a	I think this app is good  there is no ads I thank the creater you can also touch it and moves around when you touch it awsomeley amazing
6063	4	a	Good selection to pick from.
6064	3	a	"Please make it work faster and make it's graphics better to work on my device \huawei P6\"""""
6065	5	a	Better than any other app! Now, I've got my LG G6, so look out! I'm \nwaterproof and getting the good shots!
6066	5	a	SpYfyt Hiiii... Currently playing Yoshioka route... Let's be friends 😊😊😊
6067	1	a	Well, I used to love this game. I had almost 20 floors and really enjoyed playing. But all of a sudden after a month of not using it, the game deleted itself and I lost all of my progress as well as the money I spent in the game. I officially hate this company, and I have no more intention of playing anymore of their games. I've had this game for years, and all of a sudden my profile doesnt exist anymore? I'm very disappointed in you guys.
6068	2	a	Lorraine area is bugged in the campaign mode. You can't scroll around the \nmap properly, it keeps putting the camera back in the one spot. EXTREMELY \nannoying. Any chance of a fix?

6072	5	a	I was a little sceptical at first as this is my first experience of mindfulness. Having said that, I'm sleeping better and haven't had a migraine since I started using mindpilot. Monthly subscription is a bargain if it helps me sleep properly, and it's early days yet but if it means a decrease in migraines too then this might just be the best investment I've ever made.
6073	1	a	Every time I try to open it, it just closes and taken me back to my home screen.. and that sucks
6074	4	a	Appen er sgu god nok. Eneste problem var da jeg skulle have en engangkode så gik appen tilbage og derfor kunne jeg ikke skrive engangskoden. Det betød jeg måtte få en ny engangskode .Selve ungdomskort systemet er lidt åndssvagt . Hvorfor vente 15 dage på at man kan bruge et elektronisk kort. 7 dage burde være nok til at ændre det på alle trafikselskabers servere.
6075	5	a	Omg I love this wallpaper background!! I love how it doesn't show the like app just the word its awesome man!!

6080	5	a	My remote went toast and have to wait for 3 days for replacement... 3 DAYS!!!!...WHAT??? Good thing I download this apps and I'm back to business. No more waiting.. will never need for a replacement again.
6081	4	a	Plays a great game! however it counts slowly, seems to frequently deal similar hands in a row, opponent too many times will peg lots of points with no points in hand, but mirrors mine so pegs very well. the display is easy to read. at higher levels it plays very well. the stats are a storehouse of knowledge, love it. and it's FREE! after playing a lot the deals seem not random, the hints not as good as my style, and too many AI hands too close to mine. doesn't seem random and feels manipulated.
6082	1	a	É uma vergonha esta aplicação no andriod 4
6083	3	a	Completed all tournaments in a few hours of purchase. Needs more locations and the animated background is looped too quickly plus would be nice of it, was off a higher quality.
6084	2	a	First of all, there nothing in their cups, second of all, they have boring \nactions. Please make this game a little more entertaining.
6085	1	a	Very bad and not working I need your help
6086	5	a	On Nitori's private island, she accidentally makes clones of Hina which are now all over the world? Can you help make the best clone and rid of the swarms?
6087	1	a	Worked for a time but now refuses to connect. Re installed, reset camera settings  still wont work. Totally utterly useless
6088	3	a	Played this off and on for years, primarily to obtain gold/jewels/promotional goals for other games. Lost interest when goals were rarely if ever introduced after reaching certain levels. Would rejoin if goals were a regular part of the game regardless of the level.
6089	5	a	Amazing game  it is
6090	5	a	I can never have enough of them. Plus it is a great time waster.
6091	1	a	" it would definitely get 5 stars."""
6092	1	a	I been waiting like for an hour but it didn't come made me an my cousin angry
6093	5	a	This app is just excellent. It's 4-in-1 and easy on the go
6094	5	a	The best game ever love it
6095	5	a	Yummy and beautiful ice cream! This ice cream shop game is so nice and wonderful and so fun. You can even pick a cone or bowl!
6096	5	a	Simple and excellent tool. I tried many, but satisfied with this app.
6097	5	a	A very nice work by the developers. Sri Rama will bless you and your families
6098	5	a	There should be more levels
6099	1	a	None of the add ons will work
6100	3	a	I have a thousand pictures on my phone and I only get to see 20 of them. They are all in the same folder too. Google generally makes things that work... Plus the transition effects do not work at all!
6101	5	a	More people should get this app
6102	5	a	I like the color of the cards
6103	1	a	this app disables my phone, when I tap on applications to choose, it just freezes my screen.
6104	2	a	On Samsung galaxy tab s3 I am unable to rename the title of the note. Also there is no hand detection so writing is getting all messy with unwanted lines.Mainly I am unable to rename so it is kind of useless since I would have to keep a separate record of what the document is about. I can only name folders but not note titles.
6105	5	a	Works perfectly on my s4 i9500. Stopped the sound notification coz we can be in washroom when it reads. Jazakumullaahu khair
6106	5	a	Not only does this app let me make ringtones with amazing ease, it also lets me edit the time codes. Works great with my Galaxy Note II and my husband's Galaxy Blaze. Works best for me coupled with MP3 Music Download from the Google Play Store.
6107	5	a	As a lot of people say it is great BUT when making the GIF it is not that clear \u0026  this is disappointing..  other than that IT IS GREAT ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
6108	1	a	I put in ideas for usernames and they r all taken....😤😥
6109	5	a	Nice game once played a few times
6110	4	a	Great job even getting this to work on a mobile device!  However, even though I can see the text data, the planes aren't properly plotted on the map. Also, I'd like the option to close the text display or the map and use the whole screen for one at a time.
6111	4	a	Would suggest to add more prayer and bhajan
6112	2	a	I will give 5 stars once you update it again to allow private chat . I can no longer private chat people in the app anymore. Fix please.
6113	3	a	whats the problem to not work how i can foxit
6114	5	a	A herbivore?eating meat from other dinosaurs?lol so funny anyway,nice game lol xD
6115	1	a	Not scrobbling on Google pixel 2. Tried clearing credentials and \nauthenticating again and still doesn't scrobble. Will show now playing but \nnot last scrobbled track on my account. Nothing is in the scribble cache \neither
6116	1	a	Does nothing.  The concept is great, and works beautifully in the katakana version.  But this app literally closes the second it tries to open.  Too bad, clearly the developers had no clue what they were doing.  I'm keeping this in my wishlist in case they decide to make a functional app one day: but for now, it is useless for anything but raising my blood pressure.
6117	5	a	Love it is the best and its gorgeous
6118	5	a	very very good thonk you
6119	2	a	Really nice ui, but Im not using a file manager with ads... sorry!
6120	5	a	It is a good app and I love it because their is bakhti my name Tanushree and my brother when ever he listen it  he shout like anything he don't have any bhakti 🙏🙏
6121	5	a	Good app. But it can not calculate bigha biswa.
6122	5	a	Works perfectly!! To everyone having problems it needs to be activated first in the Control Center.
6123	5	a	App je odlicna, omiljena sportska! Ispravljen je bug video klipova, ali me interesuje kada se dodje do zadnje vesti ne moze da se predje na sledecu stranu ili ucita jos starijih vesti?!
6124	3	a	Fun to play...once you start playing you cant stop...
6125	4	a	I needed to weigh some thing that I bought and got tried of waiting for friend to bring his scale and mine the battery is dead in it....
6126	3	a	I absolutely love the game, but 3 stars only because i cant backup any of my previous decisions. I lost the whole game twice. And i had to play through it twice both seasons that is, just because i didnt want any random story. Please TTG add a save feature. If im wrong, i would love to know about it.
6127	1	a	Rubbish hard to navigate. Keeps asking to save my email all the time.
6128	5	a	Read book # 1, awesome graphics!! So far cute story.
6129	3	a	Please make a camera option that scans us to make miku move after set time being still you're pose becomes new pose data miku can use.
6130	1	a	Because you have to do the same thing over
6131	1	a	Not good at all waist of time
6132	1	a	looks nice. but i get an error when installing
6133	2	a	ชอบ app นี้นะ ใช้งานได้โอเคดีตามฟังก์ชันที่มีอยู่ใน app แต่ตอนนี้เข้าไม่ได้เลย เด้งออกตลอด จะกลับมาเพิ่มจำนวนดาวให้นะคะถ้าปรับปรุงปัญหาและกลับมาใช้ได้เหมือนเดิม
6134	1	a	The app did not show up under my keyboards and I couldn't access it on my phone in the settings or otherwise. I'm super disappointed because I'm looking for a quicker way to type
6135	5	a	Awesome, it's was really enjoyable,but why only 95 lines , what about the remaining part..
6136	3	a	There's several issues like the amount of torque is way too great so the rover just spins. If you use the upwards thrust the wheels rearrange themselves randomly.
6137	3	a	It doesn't display how many stars earned each level, which makes it an extremely relaxed game (for me).
6138	1	a	Excessive fuel consumption and terrible controls.
6139	4	a	The app is best but some important things or definitions are missing some definition are wrong.
6140	5	a	Its the best app ever. I am visully impaired so it is great to have a magnifyer on my phone and not to have to carry a clunky magnifying device around
6141	5	a	Top game in two major speaking IDIOMAS.
6142	1	a	Says I am offline, when I know I am.  Please fix this. Txs. Need. To change clothes, colors,  I would rate higher, but you all haven't hardly done anything different.
6143	1	a	It won't let me play the game but I think It might be good
6144	5	a	Well... I use it quite a lot. The product is always great. There may be no gradient or anything fancy, but because of that simplicity, easy to use. I think the product depends on your knowlege of graphic design and the usage of the fonts. It's so simple and amazing. It's ad-free and doesn't take up much space.
6145	3	a	Most of the time its unable to wake up Chrome Cast device from slideshow. Have to fiddle around and reboot to get it out of screen saver mode. But once it gets going the video continuous flawlessly. Not bad for a free app. Hope they will fix the software issue to fix the above mentioned issue. Thank you.
6146	1	a	The stupidest game I've never seen
6147	3	a	LvwVzF I'm on Shii Masato. Story line is a bit forceful, it is not quite well writen so you can loose interest at times. I haven't tried other stories yet
6148	5	a	I always love to play solitaire card's, This game was always first choice for me. It help's our mind especially mine.
6149	2	a	Don't get much more boring than this game. Nothing to work towards, besides points just to upgrade, and the board is never ending if you don't die. ....Creators could do A LOT, or even just a little, to make this worth playing.
6150	1	a	It doesn't let u shoot crocs
6151	3	a	Its very educational helps a lot.
6152	5	a	Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu just  ummmmmmmm i  been  use ing it
6153	1	a	At first i could not upload it when I finally got it so slow and to foggy worst game ever
6154	1	a	Forced to download app b/c the website wasn't loading pictures of cases. Thought the app might be better for shopping. Nope. Even worse. No sure how I'm supposed to buy cases when I can't see everything that's available. How can a company offer so many options, but not have a reliable website that allows customers to browse!? I give up.
6155	1	a	It's O.K. at best. Not a fee game and most certainly not revolutionary enough to be a paid game like.... lol huh? I'm not paying for that. It's a tap tap do nothing time killer.
6156	5	a	I like it a lot. Downloaded so much theme, but this one is the perfect for me.
6157	5	a	awesome app .. very informative n helpful ...
6158	4	a	I want to overlay an animated GIF in preview mode, but it only shows the GIF's first frame.
6159	1	a	9 out of 10 times I can't pick 1 out of 80 game numbers ..surprising yes, amazing no. In the gracious and charitable bonus round, rows of gifts that fill you with an eager anticipation of future idependent wealth are dancing before you containing a bounty of tokens ranging from a meager 5 to a Trump-ish 5000.  I keenly and accurately hone in with my psycic eye and unleash my inner child... I unwrap my hard earned present awaiting a cheer from the onlooking crowd and....5 ..everytime...again...I am AMAZING!
6160	4	a	Great app. Would be great to add an offset account option showing interest savings.
6161	5	a	Aplikasi yg aku tunggu2..sungguh kreatif..kayaknya idwebpulsa pelopor pertama dibisnis pulsa yg bikin aplikasi ini..bravo idwebpulsa
6162	4	a	Tampilan nya terus di perbaiki
6163	1	a	Super fed ide men da appen crasher hver gang jeg forsøger at lave en ny jagt er den ikke meget bevendt, desværre
6164	1	a	Waste of time, it's going to browsing to save png format which we want.. It's not a sticker pack they created don't download friends waste of data...
6165	4	a	Nice graphic but that robo just walking not running?its too slow...and plz add some calibrate button..im still dont understand how to use power up
6166	3	a	"Closed it for a minute to answer a text message and when I opened it again, all of the words were gone and my.\marked\"" words were gone ! :("""
6167	1	a	WHR is starjalsa I didn't find any starjalsa .......
6168	3	a	Why does the music stop when my phone screen turns off . It's annoying cuz I expect it to keep playing while not using my phone. Plz fix.
6169	1	a	Terrible app, couldn't even register a new profile.Useless.
6170	3	a	Whenever i use swipe, after I finish swiping the second word it doubles the first word I wrote. It happens only with the first-second words written. Really annoying I have to regularly type the first word everytime. Please fix this.
6171	1	a	Don't  fix that signals
6172	4	a	Unable to make in-app purchases, access co-op (online) mode, other than that GREAT GAME! Please update soon so people can spend money on gear and upgrades! Also I would like my money back from the beginner   pack that I never received. Thanks
6173	1	a	Defines cafe' Racer. That is all. Very disappointing.  And what is the correct spelling of gallery?
6174	5	a	Easy to use and very practical
6175	5	a	Very cool with it and I will have a good idea for it everything is fine with me on this one.
6176	3	a	The app would be better if when baby touched a specific part it named it. She can press anywhere and it will say the next body part in the program. Confusing if she touches and ear and it says tummy...
6177	1	a	Downloaded both but never did anything
6178	5	a	Gave 5 so u can see what i think it doesnt even sound like the song you pick,there no recording so u cant hear yourself and the board is very small
6179	5	a	Add a confirmation notice for gem-based purchases already. One accidental click or a glitch from the game itself, and gems disappear. At least make it so that when someone does email you about an accidental gem-based purchase, they get reimbursed for it. It's Storm8's fault for not making it more difficult to accidently buy things in the first place after all. And stop blaming EVERYTHING on user wi-fi. Update your servers and fix your games already.
6180	5	a	Thanks.. I could retrieve 5 years of contacts from Old lenovo phone to my new samsung phone .. I was satisfied with Lenovo A6000 phone until it became slow after I upgraded it to lollipop from KitKat.
6181	1	a	Error todo el tiempo! Cannot buy tickets!!! Fix it!
6182	5	a	Once upon a time, in the life of Android, I findeth no offline interesting game, and boom I got here, and find the golden star 🌟, I can Bearly stop playing, everywhere I go, even kept me till late night,
6183	5	a	Super je app,  jedino fali da se moze upisati tipkovnicom potrosnja goriva, jer je tesko ovako naciljati tocan broj :)
6184	1	a	If only google can give 0 stars or maybe google can destoy dis app.
6185	5	a	Excellent!!! Thank you very much.
6186	5	a	मंञ खूप चांगले आहेत. प्रत्येकाला खूपच आवडेल धन्यवाद
6187	4	a	Needs sound and a few tweaks here and there some bigger maps would be good too but over all a simple but fun game
6188	5	a	It gains knowledge that I can see that the information you need to be a good idea
6189	1	a	Just have to tap where it says to. DONT INSTALL THIS BORING BAD GAME AND DONT WASTE YOU TIME ON IT HOW IS IT GOOD VERY BAD GOT IT
6190	5	a	Kick-ass distraction. Simple and fun.
6191	1	a	I purchased the 9.99 package and it never was added to my account, but taken from my bank account.  Please tell me how to proceed with getting my coins that I purchased.  Thank you.
6192	5	a	Make a game called washifire there will be customers and you need to wash there dirty clothes if you like tell it to me
6193	1	a	No matter what I do, will not, can not connect to ANY BLUETOOTH!!!! VERY AGGRAVATED
6194	2	a	Works great except the fact there's no security. Anyone can create an \nmanager or delete and change things. What's the point of there's no \nsecurity?!!
6195	5	a	Alexicom has been a life saver for me after a recent tracheostomy. I have muscular dystrophy and use Clicktophone with bluetooth switch to control my smartphone. Works great and easy to custimize. Support fantastic!
6196	5	a	Fun and addicting puzzle app for everyone especially for kids! Love it!
6197	5	a	Great game but would like an on/off for straffing or an option to have visual directional buttons. Also an option to use tap instead of swipe.
6198	5	a	Took up the ukulele 6 months ago, now i am ready to step up a gear or two with regards to playing and mastering the ukulele.  Simply searched for Ukulele and this one showed up, looked interesting, i have a good tuning app already so that discounted 98% of apps for uke's, and only today i spent some time learning the scales via youtube,  so this app stood out a mile and seemed perfect, and after a little play about, it is pretty much perfect, its just what i need even though i didnt know it lol  Anyway, fab app, 5 ★ from me, whoever created this, nice one \u003d)
6199	5	a	I can't get it to work on my phone or tablet and still have not gotten a Response from anyone... very disappointing
6200	5	a	I keep going back to this after trying many many other skins for go launcher.   It has enough going on to be interesting,  but doesn't get the cluttered look so many over bright and gaudy covers do.   And the weather skin matches perfectly.   I love steam punk,  so it's a win for me.   A few new icons would be awesome,  but I live it.
6201	2	a	I've only actualy played it once because thats all it allowed me to everytime i go into the game it takes forever to load and then the app fails i tried reseting my phone and even Uninstalling itbut it still isn't working please fix
6202	4	a	I like this game, except that it doesn't work on newer phones and tablets. Other than that, its a great game!
6203	2	a	This app works fine if you want to check your balances for your savings or cds. The e-deposit let me take pics and send. The actual deposit did not go through. I got a vague email to call. Called. Had to go through drawn out identification of myself. Then after i was inforned the check was illegible and not deposited. They told me to have a new check reissued. So much a waste of my tine. And even now wasting more time warning others. i will go to drive thru at the real bank.
6204	2	a	Ever since the update to Android Pie 9.0 the edits have been real bad. Like \nthey skip the first 6 seconds after every trimmed video (looks like it \nfreezes) because it doesn't load correctly unless you transcribe it, \ncausing it to lose quality.
6205	4	a	ok not so good it hangs a bit
6206	5	a	Really quick response to fix a Southern hemisphere bug
6207	5	a	Great for hand eye coodination. Fun for all ages. Who doesn't like a good explosion every once in a while.
6208	1	a	Dark Purple skin has a much better and nicer purple than this one IMO. Disappointed to see a good purple theme with not much purple in it.
6209	1	a	"I hope employers don't have to pay for this. What a waste. I ordered an ipod from the special \employees discount\"" then found out it was $10 cheaper at best buy. Deleting now."""
6210	5	a	But the controls is the arrows \u003dl
6211	4	a	Actually this game is Totally fine/good but something's Missing the weapons! Weapons should be upgradable And affordable !! Coz A Baseball Bat is not really strong at all and mind if you can add boss battles !!!
6212	2	a	I mean, it is what it is for an escape game, but the ads will drive you nuts.  They just pop up randomly, and I promise you will end up clicking them by accident about 60 times. I've never reviewed a game, but the ads are so viciously repetitive that they ruin the gameplay.
6213	5	a	I like it... Like ais cream
6214	2	a	Долго возился и так и не нашел - как сохранять статью. Скачал приложение только что бы читать без интернета, и смысл? Зачем рекламировать те функции, которых нет?
6215	5	a	Starring at my screen with this live wallpaper makes me wanna go back to my past christmas.
6216	1	a	Update the app please. This app is really outdated and crashes alot on my Andriod 7.1.2 Device. Please update to support newer versions
6217	5	a	Lots of options. Very pretty. I enjoy every time I use my phone and not a huge drain on the battery
6218	5	a	Its cool need updates on wallpapers
6219	4	a	Always have a good time with this app!!
6220	2	a	Forced to do really really simple ones for far too long, gave up trying to get to a higher level just to get a challenge.
6221	5	a	Love this app...offers everything to keep track of important issues...
6222	5	a	After updating to this version, it works fine again.
6223	1	a	Car sucks sounds bad and looks bad ive only played for 5 seconds and it sucks play extreme car driving simulator it is AWSOME
6224	5	a	Searched my home town (very small, unknown place) \u0026 it found all of the local loos. Great app.
6225	3	a	Good Cars,Just Don't Like The Steering,Wish It Had Button Options For Steering And Damage For Real Life Effect.
6226	5	a	This is a great app that does what it says. I have 7 different images, most of my home screens are empty but I just like looking at the pics of my favorite babies and kids! Always works properly and does not use a bunch or processing or battery at all. Love the features and simplicity.
6227	2	a	My cat is always playin but she didn't like this she pushed the phone away and then fell asleep
6228	3	a	The game is fun and simple. However I have issues with missile going to totally random targets. I would rather the missiles focus on aircraft then most damaged target... not random ship on other side of map behind hill.. Better missile coding\u003d5 stars.
6229	1	a	Please remove this app from the store as it does not work on almost any modern phone or version of Android and the developers are ignoring people's comments. This is not the sort of developer you want creating apps for Android. Incredibly poor and ignorant service from the developer.
6230	2	a	While playing it seems just a time pass....
6231	5	a	Have not tried to see how my son likes it yet. I need to buy a stylis for \nhim to use with it.
6232	1	a	Camera warnings happen when traveling in the opposite direction of enforcement and not at all in the enforced direction. I complained a month ago and was told that they are aware of the issue. FIX THIS, IT'S THE CORE FUNCTION OF THE APP. I would like a refund. I paid $15 for this feature. Since you can't seem to fix this, issue refunds.
6233	1	a	Win a race buy add free version comes up and the money and bracket I just started is lost and I have no money. Graphics keep going crazy and not working at all at one point I was driving a lot of rim pices... that was my whole truck. Real rough game.
6234	5	a	Love the game add more plane plss
6235	5	a	My nexus support 11 !!
6236	5	a	I'll be there soon.. :)  Best app without app.. You can feel you have already known London..  Thanks :)
6237	2	a	Cudi aplikaciaa ..chedavs da cudi xarisxia
6238	1	a	One fine morning its stopped working
6239	5	a	So cute i just cant even!!!!!
6240	5	a	I go walking quite a lot and this app is perfect for my needs. I can plan my route in advance and then all I need is my phone rather than taking a paper map that might get damaged or damp. There seem to be quite a few very critical reviews of this app, but I don't understand most of them - they don't match my experience at all.
6241	3	a	Great game! Good graphics, and decent sound. Crashes whenever I am in combat, and bugs where the animation loops over a specific action several times. Samsung Galaxy S4 just might not be compatible.
6242	4	a	But I have to reapply every day after updating to the latest nightly. Is there a way to automate it by having a flashable zip?
6243	4	a	*slow down loading               *uses lots of space :456mb please change or no apps like this one!!!
6244	5	a	Great videos but requires a membership.
6245	5	a	Wow this is awesome, I love it.
6246	5	a	I choose the village walk aroud herobrone appeard nearby a tree but he didn't go after me and also once herobrines face appears on the screen
6247	5	a	Great widget. Have been trying to make purchase of your widget. Don't know \nhow much it is. Or how to buy it. There is no information on your site or \nin the Play Store. Please advise.
6248	4	a	Works well but not always
6249	1	a	Lagta hy adds dekhany k lye install ki hy
6250	1	a	Because of VERY BAD graphics, the steering wheel inside doesnt turn, there is no stop lights or stop signs, no other cars, no truck modifications and no realism so dont download it
6251	5	a	Great app - works well on Samsung s3
6252	1	a	CAN NOT MOVE WHAT I NEED TO MOVE STAY WELL CLEAR
6253	3	a	It is ok but it's Hard to Move their are To Manny Adds and I'd like it More \nif It was Fix and Please Ad a Abandoned House Maze To it that be Really \nCool a Maze that Looks like a Abandoned House
6254	5	a	I love it because it is so cute😁
6255	3	a	La aplicación es buena ofrece información necesaria aunque tiene sus \nmomentos en los que no se puede acceder a ella, además de que antes se \npodían realizar cambios de plan directamente en la aplicación es la razón \npor la que le doy solo 3 estrellas, deberían aumentar servicios no \nelimonarlos.
6256	5	a	I really like this interactive book!
6257	5	a	Different game, gets bit repetitive
6258	1	a	my first cp is explode for my cps heating i hate this game the maker of this game will spend 30 000 pes
6259	4	a	You need to understand german
6260	4	a	Great game idea, cute pug and no ads! Only thing is that it gets a bit frustrating
6261	5	a	Paprasta, patogu. Tik galėtų atsiųsti pranešimą (push notification) kai bilieto galiojimo laikas eina į pabaigą ir poto kai pasibaigė
6262	1	a	This is a terrible game. The rules are flawed when the computer makes 5 moves n your allowed 1 of course u will loose
6263	4	a	Super cool but it got a bad glitch and I had to reinstall it. Then I got to the last level and there was no more. I like it so much I keep playing but I need more.
6264	5	a	Awesome retro game. MiGs are nice planes.
6265	1	a	Speed limit icon never changed (stayed at 55 while going through a 45 to 35 speed limit zone) but it did read how fast I was going... Unless you want traffic tickets, I'd stay away from this app...
6266	4	a	Stories come and go much too quickly.
6267	1	a	This app constantly crashes. Fix it.
6268	5	a	It lots of fun and instead of making you spend money for fun it  will let you play  with unlocks be for just 1doller
6269	2	a	Should add an easy way to enter the Peters, so that I could really use the box to navigate. And who designed the application? Never seen anything so bad!
6270	3	a	What about variable tax brackets, for example if you have tax offsets eg property investment
6271	1	a	At bat is way better
6272	5	a	App is the best if u use it to your creative ablity.  Any sound with min. File space.  I have a media converter app so for example a piano rythym with 10 seconds of play wont fit in one of the pads but with converter making file smaller, fits. So playing a drum with clap, chord, guitar any musical sound comes easier to perfecting a beat or rythm. Shout out to devolopers. Suggestion add more pads and option to add to recording. Sorry, but maybe 10 years now with this beat pad. Love it
6273	5	a	Right up my alley, I'm a huge astronomy buff, and the theme covers the two panels that I use. Thank You \u0026lt;3
6274	1	a	Doesn't work @ Samsung Galaxy s6 with hdq40
6275	5	a	Speaking as someone who has a smaller board game table, thank you for making an app that allows me to actually have enough room to play this awesome game.
6276	3	a	It is a good app for kids
6277	4	a	Program yg bagus, sangat uaer friendly. Kekurangan hanya tidak adanya cctv toll jasamarga saja. 5 bintang kalo ini bisa dimasukkan, jadi tidak perlu pakai app2 lain lagi.
6278	1	a	Bad filing colom say try again a60 mobile
6279	4	a	I just set this up so im not sure
6280	1	a	This app sucks it is in a diffrent language and i cant read it(uninstalled)
6281	3	a	Good game but intermittent fault on start button function.at various times pressing start button to either gamble or just spin the reels does nothing.fix this.I'm on a gigaset tab and all other games work OK but this fault is frustrating.meaning I have to come o UT of the game and restart.if fixed a definite five stars.
6282	3	a	This app used to work untill generic failure started to show up at every msg sent...
6283	1	a	I expected this to be good but no. The screen turned black on me! And plus its crashy and I made a bad meme!
6284	5	a	This is absolutely FREE!!! Thnx
6285	1	a	Why is this app available to download? I can't register in the application, it just errors out. I've googled to try finding an alternate way to do this and find people complaining about this from way back in January, no link or information on where I can register. I love the actual game, but what is going on with the app? This is really badly done. How am I to register and make use of it?
6286	5	a	Very good thanks so much
6287	1	a	Each time I enter it wont work
6288	2	a	Precesto u zadnje vreme blokira kod ucitavanja vesti. Popravite to.
6289	1	a	They will take steal your credit card info
6290	5	a	this has been my favourite game since 2011. great game to get my mind off things
6291	5	a	The only downside to this app is the repeating tasks always move back to the start of the next day, instead of repeating at the same time each day. Another issue is my different synced calendars don't show the same color as they're supposed to.
6292	1	a	There are some mistakes like Zair Zabar are not accurate so please do not download this or Admin please sort this out. Thank you
6293	1	a	" no video. Ports are correct and the signal is going through but...can't see any video locally or mobile."""
6294	1	a	I found this app very useful, and I've been a faithful subscriber ever since the app became available on Android.  However, with the price increase to $13/mo. to renew this year (2016) - I simply cannot justify the expense.  I would recommend you grandfather faithful customers like me on the terms we've been paying for years.  Also, if you are going to start charging astronomical prices, you'd best deliver astronomical new features and advancements, for starters; add the ability to more comprehensively manage and close events, not just tasks.  There's so much more that could be done, but more than doubling the price for the same old product, features, and functionality is unconscionable!
6295	4	a	" I love this game. Used to play every day and got to like 8000 before woohoo. Nostalgic hearing the music again. Rated 4 cause I don't understand why they got rid of some features but whatever."""
6296	1	a	It gave you more credits. It had a lot of better graphics, but it wouldn't even let me play it. It kept force closing

6300	1	a	I update the app and the widget won't work so I reinstalled the app but the problem now is how do I get my premier account back? I already bought it now the app said I have to buy it again. Please correct my premier account.
6301	4	a	Wish it would use data connection instead of GPS, but this app is incredible for a trained storm spotter.

6304	5	a	I like it use this enkrej knowage from this.
6305	4	a	The only reason I give it a four stars it keeps begging for a 5-star \nrating. I hate apps that beg for 5 star ratings
6306	5	a	This app is really good and doesn't crash or anything for me but how do you save your projects to your gallery? I am trying to save it so I can upload it to my YouTube account but HOW? I can't!!! Help please!
6307	5	a	Great! I only wish I had the ability to take the English out and insert it later as needed. For children that read English, they read English only and ignore the Arabic.
6308	1	a	" or you don't play. UNINSTALLED."""
6309	5	a	Dear Team Lava, i occassionally played this game for 1 year. Then i had to changed my phone. So, is there any ways that i can get my old accounts. ? I already in high level. :'(
6310	4	a	It's a good time waster
6311	1	a	SORRY, force close welcome me when I open app for the first time after I downloaded,  This is it. I was little doubted before I installed because not updating the app for so long but I just tried it but exactly happened when I open. Moreover I can't play even a single song from all language, yriwdany time and spent more than 45minutes but the response was death. Therefore I have to uninstall again by now sorry. You guys deserves ZERO star.

6317	5	a	I've been using BB for a few weeks now and I've had only one problem. When I try to log into my Hotmail account, I click the box to enter my user name/password but the keyboard doesn't work. I have to switch to my default keyboard to enter my data and the save to my browser. I have big fingers so I love the large keys. I would recommend this app to anyone that has trouble typing on the small default keyboard.

6332	5	a	great! finally an app that can cast streaming videos (e.g. showbox) to Chromecast and not just mirror. Means  the screen doesn't have to stay on all the time, plus I can use my phone for other things. Have used this superb app for several months now with no problems. Without doubt the best app in the Play Store for Chromecasting streamed video. Thank you so much to the developer!
6333	1	a	Could have been something beautiful, unfortunately...
6334	1	a	torch keeps on going out
6335	5	a	So I couldn't read all my Sony tags with my new nexus 5. Did a little search and found this to be the soultion. THANKS SO HAPPY
6336	5	a	Astonishing application!  A bit of too much delay even on Galaxy Note 3, and not very usable for any live play attempts. But even than, deserve 5 stars! !!
6337	2	a	But it keeps crashing which then drains my battery.
6338	5	a	Glad I Have This App, it Shows sprint is the fastest in my town. cool to play with and add to.
6339	1	a	Can't get it to do anything. Often freezes and I have to force close. Uninstalling.
6340	2	a	Will not let me send pics in messages
6341	5	a	It's a good app one of the beat I got on my phone it works better than all the compasses I have had before and the direction it shows towards the the khabba is right advise you to install it

6347	4	a	Good compilation of duas... Thank you putting in so many efforts to bring out this app. Jazakallahi khair an.  Would have been still better if audio option would have been all the duas.
6348	5	a	Its awsome i can vainsh everything away and not let a spec pehinde
6349	5	a	I like this game very much. No one can't wait to give 5 stars. It is entertaining all the aged groups. And from me a advice we want like this games a lot
6350	3	a	What is your potable id ive typed my Username and Email ???
6351	1	a	Froze my whole phone, had to uninstall to get my phone back to normal.
6352	2	a	Worked great with N7 player.  Now just stops every time I try to cast.  Would have given 1 or even 0, but it did work well.
6353	3	a	sometimes app stops itself.it do not show timings while screen is off
6354	4	a	Great concept, sticking to SFL2
6355	1	a	Ever since the update to the main flipclock app the glass flipclock app doesn't work properly. The frame shrank and every thing on the glass display is smashed together. Please fix. I really love this app. But Will rate 1 Star till problem is fix.
6356	3	a	But the fact I actually paid for guns with real money and this app won't let me restore my guns I had! ! Yes I am piss ed off about it, bc I spent a lot of time on this game I want the guns I paid for!!
6357	3	a	Love the game. There's issues that need fixed. I am not able to visit my friends. The game will not allow me to log into Facebook. Fix this and the star rating will be higher.
6358	1	a	Other app or game makers should stop copying Ketchapp! They do anything 100x better and they don't copy others!!
6359	4	a	Challenging puzzles. Wish it included Google Play achievements.
6360	5	a	This is exactly what I was looking for. In fact I didn't quite realise how much I needed it until I used it. It has transformed the way I use my phone. Thank you

6367	5	a	Veeeeeeeeery Gooooooooooood واقعا قابل تحسين است چون چیزی را که می خواهی می توانی در این مکتبة دریابی از دوستان به نصب این برنامه دعوت می کنم.
6368	1	a	I paid. I did not get it.
6369	4	a	It is a good game but i have 2 icon identical on my phone. When i uninstall one of them bot of them dissapear
6370	5	a	Its a great time passing game and much more addictive than you would think. Wish more maps would be added soon as i have played all available maps and some new would be great
6371	1	a	I don't  like  this, but  it's OK.😺
6372	3	a	The game is really good but there's nobody online for PvP.. There's only 2 people online all day but they are bots and when u join matches they are not moving at all. Not really impressed with this cuz I was mainly looking to PvP here but I can't cuz there's nobody online. U guys should do what shadow gun deadzone does ands merge both Android and IOS servers into 1 server that way the population will increase and u will have more active players and more active players\u003d more money for u guy so it's a win-win for everyone. Also add a chat so we can directly request people to come PvP and also have a chat and make friends in chat. I hope u guys implement this with the server merge in t next update until then c u later:))
6373	5	a	At first I thought it was just a simulator, but after cutting of 9 of my brothers fingers I have a different opinion. I cut down the tree in my backyard in no time at all. The best time to use this app is of you ever find yourself in the middle of a Sharknado. Now you can go to the rainforest and go Paul Bunyan on all those trees. Make sure you keep the chain oiled. You should normally use bar oil but if you're in a bind KY Jelly will do the trick.
6374	4	a	Really enjoying the game but the ads are annoying. Also maybe give more hints or clues
6375	5	a	A great app to navigate and use, type in what you want to see and boom you got it
6376	5	a	Nice graphics. Very small levels. But I enjoyed it.
6377	5	a	It's nice i like how the bombs help me finish.
6378	5	a	Very good app.easy to make collage
6379	5	a	I really enjoy this game. It's so real life like.
6380	5	a	This is such a soothing wallpaper of my favorite flowers! I'll prob buy the paid version :-) thank you for so much creativity!
6381	1	a	THE worst password policy I've ever come across, I tried a dozen different memorable password, all rejected. Don't download, it's not worth it. Use a card for simplicity, that's what I'm gonna do from now on. well done tech team, your app is too difficult to log on to.
6382	5	a	Recent versions (up to 3.8.0.3) have been sluggish/broken. Have reverted to version 3.6.7.3, which works great!
6383	1	a	This app stopped working about 3 months ago, and when it did work it ran in the background giving inaccurate results. It pretend test every few days but ever time I open it there's no results. The problem is that the FCC is using the data from the app and makes public policy as a result. It would be better to have no data than the garbage from this app. Why did the app stop saving the test after I got 1gig Internet from a munibroadband provider? COMCAST!!!! Brian Roberts your empire is going down.
6384	1	a	Hate it. Deleting as of now
6385	5	a	This is great! Simple, clean and on top secures privacy by not syncing anywhere. Thank you for making week numbers optional!!
6386	5	a	I roasted my friend and he cried tell his mom came home and she was in Maine they live in California
6387	5	a	Why isn't this game working this is starting to get on my nerves
6388	5	a	This is the best Video Player I ever used. So super and too much options available. Even MP3 can play in this app.
6389	1	a	On time once, on occassion when reservation was done driver calls to \nharrasse to come down earlier. Sometimes they would not show up and not \ncall to give enough ample time for youvto call for another car.. It is rare \nif I complain. This car service is NOT realable nor responsible.
6390	3	a	Needs to have the option for landscape (to small to see)
6391	5	a	I FOUND BOTH HIDDEN PARTS! :D Extremely funny and great CPU's. And here is how find the HIDDEN PARTS... When you start the game, the last two barrier's at the bottom right, you need to HIT them and you will go to a secret part. ;-) Q: How did you find them? A: I wanted to knock down all the barrier's .  Q: What do the Hidden Parts look like? A: 1. Hidden Part 1 is the Dojo with 1 character and you can knock him down. A: 2. Hidden Part 2 is 2 characters on a platform and you can tilt it the way you tilt your mobile device.
6392	5	a	Need a shop and items. a chat function maybe. Dagger would be nice lol. Add more features and other maps.
6393	4	a	I like this game and I HIGHLY recommend it if u are a person like me who are sometimes just plain bored and nothing in the world could FIX IT.....but it would be nice if the creator made it to each fish has a different sound and a power up or after the 5th one you start getting power ups......the more it cost the better the power up.....you should consider adding it that way it give people a reason to want to collect coins and actully play this.......thx (CONSIDER IT! Plz!!)
6394	5	a	Really good best game if ever played. I LOVE the videos
6395	1	a	Had to give it one star so i could get to this box to tell you how crappy it was.

6406	2	a	Lol it duz say 2011 lmao nice colours.  but uninstalling!!! Need more free themes DEV!!!
6407	3	a	Really sweet little app that makes my home screen shine. But, no support so I'm removing 2 stars. Too bad
6408	3	a	I got this app to fix badly named/titled downloads which is exactly what it did.
6409	1	a	It just sucks anyone can cut wires don't waste your storage on this game
6410	5	a	playing it on my windows phone too :-)
6411	1	a	Graphics are really bad and I can't pass the first level
6412	3	a	The icons are pretty, but they need categories and there needs to be more. It doesn't even have all the Google icons. Also please change the Instagram icon... It's really ugly.
6413	3	a	The chain keeps on braking
6414	3	a	Usava a App no Android porque a versao ios nao permitia várias contas. E agora retiram esta opção do Android. Espero que reponham a opcao..
6415	3	a	Why have plug-ins to what's supposed to be a lightweight flashlight app? I had to download this just to get the flashlight widget I preferred back on my screen, and it opens a notification while on that I can't disable when the main app's notification is disabled
6416	5	a	Amazing application to amazing brand
6417	5	a	This game is aw some
6418	5	a	Playing on my nvidia shield you guys should get together and make something special for tegra 4 just so the game can run smooth like a console I'm willing to pay for that..
6419	2	a	Home screen widgets not listed in the widgets list of the Android 6.0. Only notification bar info is presented for CPU and RAM in an alternate display fashion. The notification bar colors aren't the most legible. Process bar only shows the application's process.
6420	1	a	I dont even know what im doing. To many ads after ads
6421	1	a	I want to buy it without ads.! Ads totally ruin this app.
6422	3	a	I can't load the app on my Android.
6423	5	a	This really is a lot of fun, and I love the mini-games. The concept of the \napp is a bit pedestrian, but really, the enjoyment it gives makes up for \nit, especially if you have been waiting for an appointment for 30 minutes, \nbut I actually play it often, especially when I need a few moments away \nfrom the stress of real life. Nice idea for an app.
6424	5	a	Took a minute to figure it out but once i did i couldn't put it down. Excellent game! Only one thing;  i wish we can download to sd card
6425	1	a	There is nearly never a person

6427	4	a	Such a big company, please catch up with Shaw! Otherwise good job!
6428	4	a	Would like to be able to sort alphabetically
6429	5	a	Love it my kids learned very easy
6430	4	a	I like but like nothing is free. And I can't get anything not free
6431	2	a	Used to work perfectly with spotify. But it really turned into a mess. And it never syncs anymore. It's always off one or two sentences and it really became unusable. Doesn't even pops up half of the time. So please just fix the syncing problem
6432	5	a	This is a great app and works well except for one minor issue.  It needs to have an infinite scrolling option, that is not tied to the compatibility mode option.  When you loop around after your last desktop, your desktop continues in the direction you scrolled (infinite scrolling) but the wallpaper cycles back through all the other wall papers.  The app could use more transition effects too.    Otherwise wonderful app, I use it on all my android devices to keep my wallpapers fresh.
6433	2	a	I like this app more than others
6434	5	a	가끔 앱들이 요구하는 권한을 점검해 볼 필요가 있을 때 요긴하게 쓸 수 있습니다.
6435	3	a	Been a long time user. Now when I try and view all my pics in the app, it say loading images but they do not load. If I click on the placeholder it will load individual pics, but I prefer to view them all together. Hoping for a fix before baseball starts

6439	5	a	Best ever, thanks appreciate your innovation. :)
6440	1	a	I can't unhide any of my stuff moved from SD card to storage and it's eating up all my storage. I had over 11 gbs free and now it's stuck on 5 gb free for internal storage pls fix this. After is has unhidden it is still eating up all my storage. I probably have to reset my device because I cannot find the hidden videos in my storage to delete them.
6441	5	a	love this app, my go to when I need a go nights sleep and can't switch off. \nhave paid for extras. shazzys voice is lovely and relaxing
6442	2	a	it's got good graphics but the steering is too difficult
6443	4	a	Very cool, multiple players works very well in this game, and the effects are not bad at all. Love it
6444	5	a	I love it but some of the stuff you cant afford it by upgrading
6445	4	a	I really prefer SF Launcher 1 over the second version. Please do not stop supporting this version. Some additions would be really nice such as being able to put more than one widget on a page. If you really won't support this version anymore, please consider to publish the code under an open source license... Keep up the good work!
6446	5	a	Gamenya asik. Nyebelin susahnya.. hehe justru itu yg bkin oke . Semangat terus,tetap berkarya untuk game indonesia..
6447	4	a	Wish there was a way to kill the music.Can't find where to put the boat on 13 UPDATE I am on level 32 now.I love the graphics of the water.This one annoying add keeps popping up.Its like a pesky fly.After a long time of having this game,and you developers still won't kill the music!
6448	2	a	Pretty, but the widget reserves a 5x2 screen area - half my screen! - while only visibly making use of a 2x1 space.  I can think of better ways to use a 5x2 space than turning it over to a widget that wastes 80% of it.  Will you please consider updating this to use a 2x1 space?
6449	2	a	If you've seen the short film (which is free on Vimeo), don't waste your money on this game. The game doesn't add anything new or supplement the film at all, it's just like watching the film except you have to touch the screen to make things happen. Not worth $3 at all.
6450	2	a	Since did the upgrade to the game my screen is full of errors one with the message saying get to 1 tile over and over where it is hard to see the tiles to move and it's real laggy ... Please fix or go back to the old way
6451	3	a	I agree w jessie. It jus happened and dont feel like typin over. Makes me more upset. No1 cares n then app shows u same lol

6453	1	a	Took a step backward.  Lost all the points I had built up with no warning they were going away.  Game was fun and gave me reason to use app.  Removed search filter by store.
6454	4	a	I like this app is a good wallpaper
6455	4	a	It helps me get things off my mind and chest. Thank you
6456	3	a	Its nice and simple....but you can only type 30 letters! Its not really useful for me since you can only had 30 letters.
6457	2	a	It is mediocre at best.  The alternative I found has zero ads, is superior, and free.
6458	2	a	On my S3 this app worked perfect. Now on my S7 it doesn't turn on when scheduled unless i open the app. If I'm going to have to open the app to have it work i might as well just silence my phone...
6459	5	a	My egg will not hatch for some reason. I have waited 1 day and it will still not hatch someone pls respond
6460	5	a	Hours of fun with this game!
6461	1	a	Stops streaming constantly (every few minutes on strong Wi-Fi signal)  this has been happening for years on different phones and connections.  Worthless app.
6462	5	a	I've had this app on older phones, I Love It!! So excited to see the Mary app for Android. Downloaded both neither one works. I have a BlackBerry KEYone with Android 7.1.1. Please help.
6463	3	a	All ok but it do not runs without internet. Otherwise it's a fantastico game.
6464	4	a	Does NOT play well if any of last year's data is floating around on your phone. Users must manually find and wipe any remnants of TC17 before it will function correctly. After that, it is smooth sailing.
6465	4	a	Works great- allows me to send a multimedia message with an image from a URL. Would give 5 stars and pay $0.99 for an ad free version :-)
6466	2	a	Never knew in order to get an app to work i needed to download 3-4 more apps for this crap to work
6467	1	a	It is not real it is your flash light and some sounds
6468	5	a	Simple to use and works!
6469	3	a	Please add selected number highlight on game board and blackout completed numbers on number pad! It will be 10 *
6470	3	a	I've been a power amp user for years I don't quite understand how people are comparing this app to anything even close to power amp. I myself am a musician and a DJ and what I can do with power amp completely Knox this app out of the park it's pretty average aside from comparing it to power amp on just a regular scale its average
6471	5	a	so cool ! i just want to know my islamic birth date and i knew it only from this app yaaaa !
6472	5	a	Good one. But how would I know about the accuracy of graph?
6473	1	a	Does not open!!!! Please fix!
6474	4	a	You just need to fix the 4g (moblie data connection)  button on this widget because it does not work. Other than that it is fine.
6475	1	a	Soooooooooooo boring! To many ads and it's just a bunch of carp you can't really do anything
6476	4	a	Been playing this game for two years now. It's an interesting game.
6477	4	a	I like the game but the color of the mustang is dump it must be a red or black color then i will rate a 5 star
6478	2	a	One of the worst.. although I play by using very good internet connection, wifi etc, it keeps force me out ...  Delete it.
6479	5	a	I love this app i give 5 stars and I love it because it is great
6480	1	a	Can only drive can't use the controls boring as hell these games seem to have no effort in making them fun or a challenge these games for only for young children under 10 years old boring as can be uninstalled
6481	5	a	Keeps my 4G connection strong and great wireless tethering speeds
6482	4	a	I've tried the free lessons and I liked it. I just would like to know how much the whole course will cost before start paying. In addition, are we going to learn past and future tenses?
6483	2	a	Can't save pics, therefore kinda useless to me. Also, you can only fav 5 pics/ day
6484	2	a	No possibility of spatial awareness (need some kind of radar display to show which enemy is incoming). Graphics too poor to work out gunnery lead lag. Ship too fragile.
6485	5	a	Screen 1 is a very comfortably
6486	3	a	Would be wonderful if I could adjust clouds thickness and speed.
6487	5	a	Got my girl good \u003d)
6488	4	a	Nice quotes for dad with beautiful graphics
6489	5	a	the best out there, must buy
6490	5	a	I haven't played darts before but I enjoyed playing it it's not easy as it look but it's challenge to play with opponents on the game...that's why I gave 5 stars very nice.
6491	5	a	The effects are striking! Use it on new photos via the app, or photos \nyou've already taken! It gives your photos something unique. ❤️❤️❤️
6492	5	a	I love this app it is so funny if you do to many finger prints he gets mad.
6493	5	a	Omg I love this, for being an over weight 11 year old I feel this is really going to help me
6494	4	a	Please add more modern bike Ian boring
6495	1	a	"When ever I try to open the app it always says \app stopped working\"" fix this please the app sounds great"""
6496	4	a	Me gusta la aplicación y tambien el soporte me ayudó a solucionar un problema que tenía
6497	1	a	the smartband is good, but when i listen to voice notes on whatsapp it stays vibrating all the time that I'm listening to it, and it's draining my smartband's battery faster then when it didn't happen, please fix it soon
6498	5	a	Works in samsung j7 nice app.
6499	4	a	I had a royal. 20k credits. Lost due to reset thou. Installing now. Much fun
6500	3	a	i need 2 double and 3 the same pic or 4 or 5
6501	5	a	Yay she makes noise! But I'd like to see options for triggering.. She seems to trigger anytime I choose an app or go to the home screen which is SUPER ANNOYING after doing it once or twice while being productive... Auto stop mode makes animation quality jerky. Also more actions, reactions and sound options
6502	5	a	I have played several visual novels and I dare say that a2 ~due~ is one of the best vn I have ever read. The story, the characters, the music, hell even the chinese impressed me. I'm forcing everyone I know to read this, this is so great wow. Kudos to the people involved in making this masterpiece.
6503	4	a	Please ad.... Some font style in your all xperia themes..... My phones version is 4.4.4 kitkat
6504	1	a	Just links you to download another app with a few to many permissions to do something.
6505	5	a	Shout out to kiberzauras fo r making this amazing game thank you very much for putting your time and effort into this game, its so simple yet so challenging.
6506	4	a	Its an excellent game ex special if your in your drivers test
6507	2	a	Su Android 4.2 non si apre nemmeno, resta sullo splash screen. Prima dell'ultimo update funzionava benissimo... Una metafora del servizio pubblico?
6508	1	a	1.of all orcas aren't even new near people there out in the middle of the \nAlantic ocean an artic ocean 2.There is way to many adds 3. You guys are \nmaking orcas look like killing machines
6509	1	a	Curious if this is actually put out by the FCC. The app runs in the background and consumes your data by default. That's a terrible design.
6510	5	a	I love rock musics and i love this app..
6511	5	a	Great to see Sokoban from Linux on Android platform. Its really great and requires skills at many levels to complete.  I read comments from Zoltán that Easy level 57 is not solvable. But I was able to solve it and till now reached at level 70!
6512	5	a	I've tried a lot of flashcard programs, and this one is really good.  It does what it's meant to do, is very simple to use and very effective.  what I like best is how easy it is to import files (I've imported csv and txt) from the phone or sd card.  Very simple to use and very effective.
6513	5	a	Overall very good and awesome game. I play this game last couple of years. I lost my mobile when i vought new and install this gamd again the game start aid number 1 stage its very pain full moment for me. I advise to author of this game that plz attach this game to facebook.
6514	5	a	This is very relaxing.It can even put u to sleep.
6515	5	a	It is a great app
6516	4	a	love the just that sometimes it takes too long to connect and sometimes doesn't show the name of the songs
6517	5	a	Making pdf and scanning, nice app.
6518	4	a	GPS is working very fine but there is big difference in measurements. I want a option in app to multiply gps readings to make them near to actual. Then rest readings will correct automatically. Developers please give us a update soon. Rest is awsome. My best wishes to developers team.
6519	5	a	It took 0.75 second for Quick Heal Antivirus to Report its a virus
6520	1	a	the recipes are way too complicated and exotic. why not create more simple juicing recipes that aren't so expensive?
6521	5	a	Great app that works perfectly with the boardgame. Quick and simple. Not a standalone game - works with the boardgame of the same name. So much fun!
6522	1	a	Starter ikke lenger.. fiks denne
6523	3	a	This correctly displays and modifies volume for alarms, ringtone /notifications and media, but does not alter or display volume for in-call.
6524	3	a	Nice concept yet power ups are hard to aquire due to immediately flying off the screen due to  poor game development so essentially you will be stuck with the original weapon and exhaust lives until you luckily happen to grab a new weapon from a destroyed enemy.
6525	5	a	I consider myself as very very lucky. As I am getting these words without any hard work. for these words some peoples (sages) have sacrificed their whole  life
6526	1	a	Dosent even look like the pics don't waste your time
6527	3	a	It's a nice thought but poorly designed app is Slow at Navigating and all the apps are already free in the Top free section Of the play store waste of time Note 3
6528	2	a	Melding toevoegen werkt niet goed. De slider reageert niet. De hele UI reageert super sloom en werkt niet lekker. Weinig goede updates.
6529	1	a	I have paid for one year subscription but now I am unable view the downloaded subscription. App is not functioning even after updating it. Kindly refund the amount.
6530	1	a	Almost everything is indicated as mistakes. Even simple words.
6531	5	a	This works really well! Awesome! LG G5 Android 7
6532	1	a	wy it have no in english
6533	1	a	app straight up doesn't even work.
6534	5	a	الآن أصبحت الأخبار تأتيك بنفسها
6535	4	a	If you can make this game fight 1 by 1 with that movement,punch,kick,and bigger scale its gonnabe the greatest taekwondo game
6536	2	a	Every time I go to a site, switch screens, or turn my phone off, this \nwallpaper app disappears and I have to reset. Not cool.
6537	5	a	I don't keep games on my phone once i complete it. Dooors , Dooors2, \u0026 Dooors3 are the exceptions. Totally addicted. Awesome challenges. Entertaining and quick. Thank you for these games. Can hardly wait for Dooors4.
6538	1	a	Right OK this used to work on my tablet doesn't now black screen for couple of seconds then switches off. So I decided to try to pay for the game again (u know u get two choices pay without trail or  with trail before purchase) just now payed the one without a trail works fine but with trail doesn't......... why does only one work if there both the same game?
6539	2	a	The new app design is awful. Don't like it. The interface is not intuitive at all.
6540	2	a	Good fun but like people are saying get to 400 and the thing crashes! Shame.
6541	4	a	Useful off-line tide planner giving primary and secondary port heights. Has bonus of tidal stream and MetOffice inshore weather forecast. Interface could be improved e.g. when selecting tidal stream area it's not obvious where you need to click on. Recommended.
6542	1	a	It doesnt even get in
6543	5	a	I could not see the App setitng im my S7edge mobile.
6544	1	a	This is the 4th game i have installed and will not open. I have even tried this on other devices same issue...
6545	1	a	" meanwhile I pay for this every month and as it isn't working half the time the entire point is lost. FIX IT!"""
6546	1	a	Downloaded it for couple stores listed in description but app hardly has any stores. Most listed aren't there in actual app.
6547	5	a	I love this app, my nephew and I have such a great time learning the animals
6548	2	a	Don't understand this update as we don't have anything like facetime on htc or android ?
6549	1	a	რა არის რასა გავს ეს აპლიკაცია.არ მუშაობს სამსუნგ გალაქსი ს2 ზე.სამნაირი ვიდეოფლეერი მოვსინჯე არც ერთმა არ გახსნა.ვაირლესით ვცდილობდი.ინტერნეტი მაღალსიჩქარიანი მაქვს.წარმომიდგენია ოპერატორის ინტერნეტზე რას იზამს.საერთოდ თი კი მუშაობს ეს აპლიკაცია
6550	5	a	Easier than Kerbal Space Program and just as much fun.
6551	4	a	Beautiful, clean app with a lot of replay value. Simplistic but really addictive. Also has bangin music. Would be nice to have leaderboards!
6552	1	a	BORING BORING  BAD😢😢😢😢😢😪😪😪😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅Do not download it very very very Bad
6553	2	a	No auto spin \u0026 should have option to increase the bet
6554	5	a	Easy to use. Helps alot! Thank you
6555	1	a	I like the new look, but it no longer shows information for Cinemas outside Puerto Rico, so it is useless for everyone else
6556	5	a	To open the game, it's luck and afterwards your reasoning.
6557	1	a	Krijg ook melding custum rom, slechter niet het geval, repareren dus. Lijkt mij een nuttige app
6558	3	a	I have to bugs on my Galaxy S5.. first no time to avoid jumpscares like PC version. If you see them, you are hit. Also the vents make no noise which makes it hard to keep up with springtrap if my camera is down. If fixed 5/5 and I can actually recommend it.
6559	1	a	Junk junk jink samsung tab 2 rate was 45 bpm with my tab on my desk
6560	1	a	It is so important this
6561	2	a	I had to give this 2 stars because not being able to aquire new dragons except through buying is a real turn off. Otherwise would have been a 5 star. Uninstalling
6562	1	a	I hate it all it does is Buzz
6563	5	a	This is the best game in the world
6564	1	a	Too much ad boring don't download this game
6565	2	a	Why is it that i keep losing all progress i make this is the second time
6566	1	a	Lamest app ever only one voice u can use
6567	5	a	Most easy widget I ever use.wishing creator add more options.over all me loving it.a bug less ap \u003c3
6568	5	a	One of the better games out there - quite challenging and addictive.  Simple yet detailed graphics, sound effects make  me smile every time I play, music isn't annoying like some other games. Thank you for an amazing product.
6569	5	a	Great puzzle for football fans
6570	3	a	Me gustaría que hubiera algun tab para escoger en la búsqueda si deseo solo carros manuales o automaticos, soy fiel al automático y una búsqueda filtrada con este tab sería muy útil
6571	4	a	Great! I really got scared
6572	1	a	انصح بعدم تنزيله- الإعلانات مملة جدا ولاتنتهي
6573	2	a	I've used this app and it works reallyyyyy good. But when i reinstall now, it cant be opened even once.
6574	1	a	Blue screen and no graphic ten seconds into third mission
6575	4	a	Lags a little so unreliable at times
6576	2	a	Didn't work for me. Actually Im looking for a solution that I can get timely Prayer reminders which I only get once the screen wakes up or is within 5 minutes of idle time till the prayer time. Iwas hopeful that this app will resolve the matter but it didn't!
6577	1	a	Poor picture quality and ugly icon.
6578	1	a	When I finally got it to work,it was no good,wish I hadn't bothered
6579	3	a	It should have been mobile compatibility that fits in full screen of mobile with an option to select circle once with change option if required
6580	1	a	How do you play this stupid game
6581	5	a	Responsive Touch Control, Simple UI, Great color themes, and, yeah, Great time killer. Did I mention its just 25 kb? XD
6582	5	a	i like it nice app
6583	1	a	Another copy and paste garbage game.
6584	5	a	To get to sleep and drown out my roommates. Great timer function, variety of sounds, and pleasant images. Check it out, try it out, you'll stay using it like me.
6585	3	a	No English 😡      can you send me the old . I used to love this app before  :(
6586	3	a	We need  brakes on the it so we can slow down it would be funner to play the game
6587	1	a	The app won't even let me log in or create an account - apparently the servers keep timing out. Very unhappy and stressed!
6588	4	a	Very annoying that you have to go through the other games screen and main menu to get back to where you were.
6589	2	a	How the hell u. Play this game
6590	5	a	Thanks singtao for making app of the standard for andriod, now i don’t need to run for printed version and comfortably sitting or standing elsewhere to check the news!
6591	5	a	Goy shuu. Heregtei saihan app bolj. Amjilt husye hogshoon
6592	5	a	Great app! Easy to use! Highly recommend!
6593	2	a	I had paid 1.99 for this game because I had really liked tivola's pet world 3D. I assumed that I would like this one too. I don't think that the game has bad graphics or anything, its just not the game for me. Nothing against tivola, because I love their other games, but this is just not the game for me.
6594	5	a	It is nice and help me lot
6595	5	a	Good fun way to count down to Christmas. This year was better with better snow falling and spotlight which I don't remember from last year.
6596	4	a	Kind of hard to see some of the graphics
6597	1	a	The app was empty. No instructions on how the app works. UNINSTALLING!
6598	5	a	I used to use GoLauncher and this is miles better. I have been using this for about 6 months or more and I do *not* miss GoLauncher. This one is a bit different (of course) but it takes little-to-no time to learn the ins and outs of ADW EX because it's very user-friendly. I forget that I am using this app because it is *that* good! It has a lot of options and I have nothing but good things to say about ADWLauncher EX! DROID X
6599	1	a	Have to pay to have fun on it
6600	1	a	"All this is is a bunch of pregnant women trying to make up better stories. It seems like EVERYONE on this app has a \dying\"" baby in side em or lost 1."""
6601	1	a	Why is it Asian tell me why why
6602	5	a	There's no reason, I just love playing the game Solitaier.
6603	1	a	It keeps saying server not found and not signing in
6604	5	a	Posle update-a aplikacija radi odlicno. Svaka cast. Nemojte vise nista menjati.
6605	1	a	Can't find any radio stations for the Norwich area, not even Norfolk
6606	1	a	IMPROVE BUDDY.... IT WAS AWESOME.... BUT ITS NOT WORKING....... FIND OUT \nTHE PROBLEM
6607	1	a	Game was lagging badly. Froze my phone mid game. Couldn't even turn my screen off. When the screen did turn it self off, it wouldn't turn back on. Wouldn't even take a charge. Finally my phone rebooted it self. And took forever to get back to normal after reboot. Uninstalling immediately!
6608	4	a	I liked it. I pick and choose which premium items I buy because it can become expensive. I wish that saving your progress was easier. That they would connect to Facebook or Google Play
6609	4	a	It takes to long to aggie the recipe but I think it's worth good pastries.
6610	5	a	Nice,reliable and very easy app.very good voice quality and i liked the cam
6611	5	a	Juss Got The Highest Score Aha Love this Game
6612	1	a	Can the apps be saved to my gallery?
6613	2	a	After multiple trys it wont accept photo upload
6614	3	a	(Still) I find that this app frequently shuts off. I usually notice when I get a call from a number that I blocked. I would like to not have to reload this every other day. Please fix this. It seems that there is an issue with Clean Master. This happens when it cleans the junk on my device
6615	5	a	i love the sweet song and the dinos i love it so much
6616	4	a	The game is addictive and seems to play like many fantasy RPGs like D\u0026D, Diablo and others. I think it would be more suitable to a PSP, a Vita or another handheld device if not a full fledged console. I have a Nexus 7 with WiFi, and the game freezes and is sluggish. I am ok with games having in game purchases. I am now wondering if I should stick with consoles and my computers to play fantasy RPGs, shooters and other games besides simpler puzzle and strategy games.
6617	5	a	It is best English msgs app ever I have used...... Awesome words collection... Well done 👍👍👌👌
6618	2	a	It Sucks Cause This App Can't Scroll \u0026 Speak At The Same Time.
6619	1	a	If you have not Android 4.4 do not install it, the app is not able more to see all the music files, it hangs without never complete the listing and does not show all the files.
6620	5	a	I really enjoyed playing this. It had nice game play and really cool sound effects. The power-ups were painless to charge and very helpful. I found all the wonders to be very visually appealing, especially the ones with water. Oh and it has 4 game modes, insane, difficult, normal and zen. I played on Zen. If you like match 3 games, you should TOTALLY play this.
6621	2	a	Интерфейс не понравился дает впечатления недоработыванности скажем так, еще хоть бы был больше search options как например по группам или активному веществе. Сырый очень
6622	1	a	The game continues to boot loop on my nexus 9 please fix.... Great game though
6623	3	a	The  control's feel weird and unnatural after playing eagle simulator and hard to find food work needed
6624	5	a	So simple and straight forward a child could operate this app yet powerful and intuitive. Anyone who has trouble with it either doesn't have root, or must have an ancient device. I've installed this on Samsung G3 and G4, ETC One and Evo4G, and a pair of generic Chinese Android tablets. All work flawlessly. This is an outstanding app! Thank you!
6625	5	a	I think this is d best app I have ever had
6626	5	a	This is the cutest game I have ever played in my whole entire kitty love life.
6627	5	a	Simply superb. Enjoyed and easy to sing along with the audio.
6628	5	a	I love this app. Great reminder! :)
6629	1	a	Sometimes the wicket keeps falling even after 10, (100 for 13)  , the fielder will throw the ball and it won't stop and just cross the stadium, and it will hang and hang at the most unhelpful times. For a game that requires you to play for long, losing all your gameplay in a second can be intensely irritating.
6630	1	a	Just gives you the apps you can get from the store waste of thime
6631	4	a	Love the interaction concept but I'm having trouble with the red cube on level 4. No matter what I do or how I play it, I can't open it.  Which means I can't move on to the next level.
6632	5	a	I like that I can set this app to vibrate until canceled. Often when my phone is on vibrate I don't feel the vibrate. If you want it to, With this timer the timer won't stop sounding or vibrating until you notice and turn it off. Very easy to set. Easy to use.
6633	5	a	Nice app, you can add your arguments and this is debate app. Great job!
6634	5	a	I really love hello kitty and when i saw this i immediately install this. And i think it is a great game after seing their comments.
6635	4	a	It is quite hard when u first start playing it but after a while it will start to get easier and easier
6636	5	a	Guys the game is awsome.but if u show pokemon from sinnoh,kanto kalos hoeen unova and alola regions i would be nice.plz do
6637	5	a	I enjoyed this game, it kept me occupied during my travels and down time.
6638	2	a	Aber neuerdings mit Werbung :-(
6639	3	a	Ok, but the French dictionary stopped working with the last Anysoftkeyboard update...
6640	5	a	"This game is AWESOME. You should DOWNLOAD IT! Its VERY ADDICTIVE! Now Playing  \Suwa Shinobu's ROOT\"".  And I must say!  OKKO did a GREAT JOB!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND! You should PLAY HIS ROOT!

6643	5	a	I love it..I hate it..it's so dam addictive !
6644	5	a	Thank you for not putting adds in your app and not requiring permissions to access all sorts of things on my phone like all the other apps.
6645	4	a	Excellent game just needs to be longer a story would be  cool too. But I know you guys are limited still release a full game like this and ill pay for it
6646	2	a	Where did the photo goes ???  I don't want my photos of me to go to different place ans saves their. Not In English???
6647	5	a	I have yet to not be amazed when I download, listen to and use a Zvon Caustic Preset Pack.  He always has the most unique, obscure and eccentric sounds for use with Caustic 2.  These types of strange and sonically blissful presets are right up my odd and bizarre alley.  The amount of hard work that must go into creating and recording these incredibly unique sounds, is not lost on me for one second, and I really appreciate your time and dedication in creating these oddball packs.  These horns are perfect for the type of songs that I create. I've used them as a main foreground piece, but I've also found them to be invaluable as the perfect background filler that really just rounds out and completes my tracks.  I plan to purchase all of the other Zvon Preset packs that I don't currently own, which is getting smaller by the week.  If you use Caustic and you are looking for some samples like nothing else available for Caustic on the Market.  Well, you could do a heck of a lot worse than this Horn pack and all of his other available Caustic packs.  Thanks a lot Zvon and God bless.  GTab 10.1 / ICS 4.0.3
6648	4	a	Fun, but calming.  No big hurry to solve it, you can think quietly.  But I wish there were more hints.
6649	2	a	Ads make the game run slower. Ads come after too little amount of levels. Ads aren't skip-able at all. Ads are too long. Physics need some work (ball won't roll off a table it will suddenly stop if it stops bouncing) kind of addicting. Ads make it less addicting. Not something I'd recommend to a friend/fellow gamer...not even to pass time on the porcelain bowl
6650	5	a	I love it so much
6651	4	a	I think it's very interesting and educative. Really like it.
6652	4	a	Played this game now on and off for four years, love it, love the simplicity and the point accumulation - however I've noticed recently that it forgets when you've finished a game (meaning game over) and sometimes reverts back to the last level of the last game, which is a bit frustrating - can this be fixed? Also, maybe a few new bonus items (maybe one that eliminates some of the enemy balls for that round, or slows them down etc). Even though it's an old game, it could still be refreshed occasionally :-)
6653	4	a	Great app not so easy
6654	2	a	its ok, this is the app I'm looking for but when I realized it kept crashing my music app, I uninstalled

Thanx! 😊
6661	2	a	I've try to make a reading... I need the half circle for choose and 4 lay out. No matter what other say good about this game... illuminati can easily read every one mind while their reading these card for fun. For those who's gifted, it's readable but don't fit me.

6662	5	a	I  think  I  am  going  to  change  the wall paper  every  day.  It is  always  so pretty  I recommend  that people get this app and the rest  of  the  seasons  that way you won't be  bored on your  home screen  I am literally  going to  spend hours  staring at my home screen  thanks to the app .
6663	1	a	It's sucks I can do this split with photogrid ugh....it needs a makeover
6664	4	a	Иногда баги при просмотре фотографий
6665	5	a	Yes'' it is very easy to use I like......
6666	5	a	Very good it is working perfectly. it is really programmed by Muslims ,I hope' because I tried many apps all of gave me wrong direction, but this apps show the right direction. again thanks for the apps Creator.
6667	5	a	It awesome I loved it very addictive
6668	1	a	It keeps hiccuping. It's always done so but now more apparent than ever. Cannot use anymore. (pink noise)
6669	5	a	Very nice and good them.
6670	2	a	When the ads play you cannot select pieces to match. Animation stops the game while it runs. Don't bother. Read the other comments. I am not alone. Ran it on my Android Note 3
6671	1	a	Ffffound is not a thing that exists anymore. The website is down (has been for a long while now) and this app doesn't function. Needs to be removed from the Play Store!
6672	3	a	Agree with Norm. Need a couple of features. Allow manual entry, and or allow selection of numbers in phone book (home, office or mobile).
6673	3	a	If someone doesn't move for 5 days they forfeit the game. However if you get someone who's a jerk they simply offer a draw and it resets the timer on the 5 days. I have a game that i can do nothing about because this person is going to lose. It's like being held captive. Fix this and I'll bump back to 5 stars

6676	5	a	it's simple, and it works
6677	1	a	Don't get this app if u expect to get Minecraft- like scary monsters. It's just a pizzeria that you can walk around. Not only that, but you only have one torch. Now if you want a free version of Minecraft, you might just like this game. But if you are a fnaf fan like me, then DONT GET THIS GAME!!!
6678	5	a	Had to do factory reset, reinstall everything. Restore of Dropbox backed Timesheet data took less than 3 seconds.  Email response from support on how to do this took less than a minute!!
6679	5	a	Great app. Simplicity \u0026 easy to use !!
6680	5	a	Get it and then buy it..
6681	5	a	شكرا بارك الله فيك علي التطبيق
6682	4	a	Android 6.0.1  note2. cmod 13. please bug fix it soon i realy like this app on my other phone
6683	5	a	Its the best 99 cents the only problem is that it lags on my s3 even though I played fine on my older phones. Needs an update?
6684	4	a	I really like this game! Not really hard to control. My pet peeve is all of the ads, but I understand.
6685	5	a	Great game.  Always entertaining.
6686	5	a	Best kemco game out to date. It feels natural and smooth. Keep up the great work guys.
6687	5	a	Great design, good work, you guys, keep it up. Maybe a larger control area when throwing after aiming. Hard to be precise.
6688	4	a	Only bad thing is that sometimes it doesn't register where to go
6689	5	a	Thank CNN church thru just run home tub guy TV v'TV ah go TV TV ft Utd to 4th TV TV TV BBC got ft ft etc TV channel TBD DVD DVD egg TV CCTV TV eccentricity Jurassic BBC Tarzan civic fix fix can TV channel TBuD etc etc
6690	1	a	Just an advertisement platform.  Cant play as they just keep popping up.  And the games is rubbish anyway
6691	1	a	Y in heck is this in a different language I speak English not whatever the f**k this is on the game
6692	1	a	It doesnt let me update anything!  people think i am Mormon and have grey wtf!!?
6693	4	a	Widget looks awful on my screen: 1. Text positioned badly 2. Progress bar is goes accross the text 3. widget graphics is not sharp so looks bad and nothing like on preview on Google Play (low resolution graphics in use?)
6694	5	a	Hebat eadit gambar apa lagi muat turun lh
6695	1	a	For listening song only and not for download
6696	1	a	I downloaded it for getting 400rp  on drag racing
6697	1	a	Such a boring game this .Please never download this poor game.
6698	3	a	When it works it's great. Unfortunately, it stops upon opening with annoying frequency. Would like to give a 5* but it fails to frequently.
6699	1	a	It sucks...there is no search engine for people to look up games
6700	1	a	It's stupid. And it won't let me Uninstall it. VIRUS ALERT
6701	2	a	Trivia is too easy \u0026 therefore not that fun.
6702	3	a	I had the wallpaper I wanted.  So you put a different one on my phone and tell me I need to reinstall the old one if I like it?  Seriously?  Do it again and I'll find a completely different one elsewhere.
6703	5	a	nice Awesome, Its a marvelous game I love how u guys use the MEGALODON shark its a magnificent shark its one of my favorites. Yet again love the graphics.
6704	5	a	Fun, entertaining, hours of enjoyment!  I could play this game for hours! Just one request,  make this game for Kindle!  Would  love to play it on my Kindle Fire!
6705	5	a	And the app works great too.  the people that have problems with it are the ones warning labels were designed for, I think...
6706	5	a	Love, love love this game I could play it all day non stop, its the best and i have it on all my devices its a 10+
6707	5	a	This. App very slow..plz check once ...
6708	2	a	I was very disappointed with this app. The video quality is poor and the finished item does not play back. In fact, all it is is a very bad photo editing app with extremely low quality and very limited tools. Unless the developers get it right, I will only rate it at two (2) stars. And all things considered , that is being generous.
6709	1	a	Why does this app need all these permissions? Location, call monitoring, camera, SMS sending, 2g, WiFi, bla bla..... A simple app for advertising purposes and i dont know whether it using your personal informations . anyway its a good app but the developers made it a real crap.
6710	5	a	I love this witty chanllenging game! If you like connecting things this is your game! Also id advise Minecraft Pocket Edition! Thanks for this awesome app! But sometimes my entire phon crashes and restarts. Fix please!
6711	1	a	Usel. Scanning fungerar ej på Samsung S9. Lägg till mobil ID.
6712	1	a	It's waste of freaking time
6713	3	a	The one thing I hate about pregly is that you cannot look back or ahead, only at the week you are in.
6714	1	a	This app is really very slow
6715	3	a	This app for Arkham Horror is very well put together, but with its goal of reducing the need for some of the more massive decks, it fails to include the largest deck of all, the Mythos deck. Update this app to include that, and it becomes a solid 4 or even 5-star app.
6716	1	a	Not working on my galaxy s3 neo
6717	1	a	Good game shame i cant see what im doing because off the advertisements get in the way so to play it you have to press the joystick an the bombs and at the sametime close the advertisements cuz they cover up the whole screen so i uninstalled it :-(
6718	5	a	I like helicopter's, but control so slow, please make it faster. And smaller helicopter will be better, thanks.
6719	1	a	After update of the app, it is worse than useless. Can't log in on app. May take my accounts elsewhere if its not fixed soon.
6720	1	a	It doesn't show up like it showed in the pics while downloading it and it looks just white,black,and pink it don't show the cats or nothing like it do in the picture-_-
6721	5	a	rid of Exhaust and Boredom
6722	3	a	Used it for a while but then started having problems. When i open the app it quickly shuts down. I can't even log in to check anything because it closes so quickly. Uninstalled amd reinstalled multiple times and even called CS with no solution.
6723	5	a	I can't figure out what youre supposed to say when the sentries challenge you. Anybody know?
6724	5	a	I love all the people saying the game is bugged... They aren't thinking properly... They are bugged, not the game... Worked perfectly... I love all of your games!! I have to know the name of the guy I gave a lollipop to... Every time he shows up I laugh! Love that dude! Keep up the good work!
6725	1	a	The uber ad at the bottom jumps all over the screen like it's been smoking crack or something. On the first level I managed to make the key but it wouldn't work in the door.
6726	5	a	I loved it because ,it's realy/ best game ever
6727	1	a	Never ever played a game this laggy plus I hate it when u run over the lame people then blood splashes everywhere u people who made the game are a complete bad bad ones !!!!! GGRRRRR!! I would have given 0 stars if I could
6728	5	a	We r u Ursa et eye when ever get to watch this weekend for what you were really excited a geger ft was for what you were getting feedback re frozon
6729	5	a	Fun, great variety of difficulty levels.
6730	1	a	Nice clean interface BUT Does not work. Wish it did. Would hv paid for it
6731	2	a	I have been testing a lot of sms popup apps. This one had the perfect set of features. But unfortunately, they don't work. May be because they have not updated it since so much time. It would be great if they posted an update of this app
6732	4	a	" or be narrowed down to allow users to focus on blocks they have trouble with. Practice with different fonts would also be really really helpful as I found it really tough to use other resources/fonts"""
6733	1	a	Subhanallah. Islam itu sungguh indah.
6734	2	a	So I wanted to try using  this and  installed it; Next step is to register to use  it  but it insists  on having a mobile number  starting  with +91 absolutely no use in the UK.
6735	4	a	Updates made it better, the braking needs tweaking a bit, normal brake needs like half decrease in sensitivity and e-brake by a tiny bit. Also has potential for drifting, can do a little bit right now but tiny sideways traction decrease would be nice
6736	4	a	The improvement I want Is to have an all quantity to 0 button. That way I can keep the items in it but just set all quantity amounts to 0. Because I have a paid license I have almost 180 items but I want to be able to erase all quantities instead of doing all 180+ manually which takes like 15 minutes. Fix that and I give 5 stars. Thank you and good job!
6737	5	a	Just wot I've been lookn 4! Gr8t layout. Luv all da choices. Awesome app!
6738	5	a	I suck at video games.But this 1 makes it easy 2 play.U can select how u want 2 control and control the sensitivity.At 1st only 1 jet is unlocked and only 1 mission too.Don't no if u have 2 pay 4 the others or u can earn rewards 4 them.Try it 4 urself and see.
6739	3	a	I bought the full version enjoyed playing, but far too short!!! Completed in a couple of hours, what a shame.
6740	1	a	Nothing new and nothing interesting
6741	5	a	Amazing helps me with my exams my science course
6742	5	a	My two year old and six year old love these games. They are helpful with learning colors, shapes, sizes and so much more. Great for fine and gross motor too!
6743	4	a	It's a great app and I use it often for studying. I wish I could save my progress though so that I can collect data on how productive I am each day and for each task.
6744	2	a	Options are limited and it always changes the distance I put in
6745	4	a	nice, but could you take off permissions for the internet?
6746	4	a	We like playing it when we are bored
6747	5	a	Better than Settings Profiles and Tasker. Best of all, it's free.
6748	5	a	might be the best i ever have! the example sentences, the conjugation lists.. love it!
6749	5	a	This is a great app to have for your theory. This made me pass with 48 out of 50. I just done the mock test over and over. All the questions come up in the test! Highly recommended.
6750	5	a	It offers you 2 choices to buy gems or get them free.the levels are fun you meet friends your not pressed into doing anything you don't want a. Do you get to decorate it the way you want.I think people need to stop their complaining
6751	4	a	It was one of my favorite games, but you guys ruined it with one thing. Why \ndo I have to pay to get the next part? It ruined the game. I was 150 level \nwith energy, running, swimming and flying and I was ready for the fourth \nchapter. Then I found out I had to pay. This is what is having me uninstall \nthe game. You ruined it.
6752	3	a	Supper it's gud for kids going school😘😘😘💞💕
6753	1	a	It has a terrible interface. It's not set up well at all. You can't select a from unit and a to unit, press convert and get an answer. Nothing is clearly labelled. It's far from intuitive or user friendly. Keep looking.
6754	5	a	Those people that are telling that this game is boring they are totally rong.
6755	4	a	Great time playing and I cant stop .
6756	1	a	I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it's not opening!
6757	3	a	I used the screen lock feature to keep my friends and cousins out of my phone and it does not work on my LG V10 or Nexus 7. I just lost my favorite feature.
6758	1	a	Dreadful app. Slow, missing info \u0026 crashes.  Don't scroll too fast when selecting country or the app will crash. I have looked numerous times to book for the USA but can't find it as an option, asked a few friends to check and they have the same issues.
6759	2	a	I don't know how to apply this theme, it says installed but hasn't applied
6760	5	a	Download.....and judge for yourself. No more boring photo livewallpaper....THIS LOOKS AMAZING. 5/5 Thumbs up to developer.
6761	4	a	Emergency+ is ok but could do more - could have an In Emergency mode, auto \nsend SMS with name, location to 106, etc.
6762	4	a	Nice game to my baby
6763	1	a	I don't know what this game is Like because I just got it
6764	5	a	Hidden object games give me a challenge to look for things that are not normally seen by the naked eye
6765	5	a	Best app for those who want to learn English.
6766	1	a	With so many adds over and over about same thing, lasting 30 seconds each time even after changing something in Settings, Good game just ruined
6767	5	a	Most Bestest.ap OM  CHANTING sathamen good music tatha bell sounds ke 10 options wala aur ek APPLICATION ka sroojan Kare.
6768	1	a	My S4 mini just shows garbage on the screen.
6769	5	a	It is very good game and its graphic is very nice keep it dude
6770	5	a	It is very nice game and I like it
6771	5	a	I will give five star without using it because i read all about of this and its sounds work so good with 3.8 rate of stars.
6772	5	a	I love this game with a passion it's got great graphics, great game play, and it's actually very challenging, I have been showing it to all my friends and some have even downloaded it themselves!!! Keep up the good work with all the games you guys create, I don't think there has been a game by you guys I've downloaded that I have not thoroughly enjoyed playing!! And when I was having issues with the game not only did you guy's fix it but it was fixed within a day or two from when the issue was reported!!
6773	5	a	I love it. It just needs to be where u can build ur on car \u0026 motor from the start. I dnt like how u cnt change nothing on the cars but the colors of things.
6774	4	a	Idk what all these other comments are about, it's just like the game show. Besides the fact the whammies don't look like whammies and they're not dancing around laughing at you....It's just the same. Lbvs nice job creators.
6775	3	a	I wanted an app that would account for my time as I travel for work.  Only problem is that this app doesn't understand time zone changes so the hours are always wrong.
6776	1	a	Time has changed. Improve your graphics and lower the price of the full version.
6777	5	a	good daily stimulation for the mind. I'm 80 years old and it keeps me sharp
6778	5	a	Its really amazing.  Its the  best  app for the  rookies.  Its really helpfull for learning Korean alphabet
6779	5	a	Ohh I love It ! So funny haha xD
6780	1	a	To bad game, bad controls,to boring
6781	3	a	Probleme mit der Darstellung,beim Wechsel auf Termine bleibt due Anzeige blau
6782	4	a	I used to love playing this game about 3 years ago on my PC. When I found out that it was an app, I immediately downloaded it. But I was a little bit dissapointed because u can't buy much ornaments and buy the research things unless u buy the whole version. I'm an android user and my brother has this app on his iPhone. I thought that it was unfair that iPhone users don't need to buy the full version in order to purchase everything on the game. If we had the same opportunities as iPhone users, I think that m
6783	4	a	This app is wonderful! I have been using it for years-thanks. I do have a suggestion though. In my humble opinion, i feel this app would be perfect with 1) the possibility of a LOG-IN NAME so that we would be able to manage our saved data when changing phones/devices and 2) having a PAUSE BUTTON option for pauses in my lecture.  Keep up your innovation!
6784	1	a	Omg I thought this was gonna be so girl but I pressed on the wallpaper and this came up.youhave to BUY THE FREAKING FULL GAME
6785	1	a	I HATE THIS GAME I DONT KNOW HOW TO FLY!!!
6786	5	a	Should be a standard feature on all smart phones.
6787	2	a	מאז שהצתרפי פעם אחת היו לי קופונים ומאז כל פעם שאני נכנס אין קופונים בכלל!! אז למה צריך את קטגוריה הזו?
6788	2	a	But does not connect to metasploit any longer
6789	4	a	This app very useful for high school students . The concepts are so simple to understand. The quiz for every section makes thorough. But the blurred text and ads are irritating. anyways I suggest this book for all high school students.
6790	1	a	Pressing on any recipe link crashes the app.
6791	5	a	Why dont u add any one of these last 4 tracks to the set of default unlocked tracks. It will defenitly create more interest in ur game. As a player I didn't knew there were these tracks. (The thumbnails doesn't convey anything also) I uninstalled this an year back thinking nothing is new in this game. I came back for a project and came to know u were hiding all the goodness of ur game till the end.these r someWords of wisdom by a game designer, my friend. Never hide the best part of ur game.Amazing job BTW.
6792	5	a	I love this game i will never stop playing it
6793	1	a	Time waster but not a fun one
6794	3	a	"App du. Support andriod 9.0 using Huawei Mate20Pro, keep prompting \This App. Is build for an. Older version\"""""
6795	3	a	I loved this app when I first got it but I had to re-install the app a few weeks ago (not due to the app). However, when I re-installed the app it would no longer sync new categories to the items list. I ended up uninstalling it and finding a different app altogether.
6796	5	a	It work i loved it merry chrismas to all 😊😊
6797	4	a	The first two levels are quite easy but as you advance it's more of a challenge.
6798	3	a	Started off so promising, a lovely platformer with responsive controls. Unfortunately turned into 5 minutes of boring. Could be great if it were fledged out into a longer game with the story actually matching the action.
6799	1	a	Wrong signs when long pressing
6800	1	a	Iran can not be used
6801	2	a	Never got a chance to play because the game won't load
6802	5	a	The graphics are great. Plenty of fun stuff to occupy my 3yr old son. He loves painting the cars and the racing game the best. Keep up the good work!
6803	5	a	Downlode this game is awesome!!..
6804	5	a	I rarely rate apps, let alone write reviews. This one deserves the effort and love though. The app is straight to the point, does what it says, and seems to be currently one of a kind in its function. Did I mention it doesnt choke you with stupid ads and does not exploit your phone? Joint Pic App for President 2016.
6805	3	a	Its harde and i love that kind of games. Put i dont Want to buy the full verccion and i cant play now. I loved this game:'( please fix guides thanks then I'll Put 5 stars :)
6806	1	a	This game is not getting opened even, on galaxy J7 2016, also tried on OppoF3 but same issue . Please have a look in to the issue..
6807	5	a	Really good game if you could update the cocpit looks that would be awesome! Anyway great game!
6808	4	a	Any way to make the app compatible with xbox one? I.e. can connect same as Google Chrome?
6809	1	a	Wont let you load your own photos but doesnt advise a solution or why. Disappointed
6810	5	a	This app knows every concevable unit! Not quite as versatile as the linux command line tool, but still very useful.
6811	1	a	honestly, this is a consistently horrible app. more than half the features dont work or just put you through a login loop. poor and clunky UI design. come on
6812	5	a	The person that says it is bad for (little) kids would get an F in school for a persuasive paper. I disagree Because if this game were rated it would be everyone 10 and up. Secondly there is only one character that is slightly innapropiate. Lastly this game is not supposed to be bad for little kids but it does have things that are funny in a bad way.
6813	5	a	Grate app, its perfectly work for uploading data to the Thingspeak server.
6814	1	a	I never said anything and still moved
6815	1	a	"It won't let me do anything on the app it says \it's not responding'"""
6816	5	a	Its best but i cant play all the levels its locked
6817	1	a	Yo pague por la aplicación y no puedo usarla en la versión full ,espero lo arreglen pronto
6818	5	a	Love it! If so, can you link where you got the samples from???
6819	5	a	Smiply awesome.... I haven't played dart bfr....even i dnt knw how to ply...bt i enjy now.... Extra 5 star 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟  by... Gr8 job guys....n thnku for ths game
6820	1	a	The first time left p
6821	5	a	can you make a steelers theme :)
6822	1	a	Clunky, limited functionality. Poor search. Almost enough to want to make the change to a different crm to get a decent app. When you are on the road, this app causes more headaches than assistance
6823	5	a	We could use a widget on this one
6824	2	a	All dictionary words are displayed inverted, need to be fixed!
6825	5	a	many time i had play this game in other device it superb game i love this game but recently i had downlod this game in my new samsung galaxy s duos  GT-s7562 but i crash. first it start it will start music after waiting some time it give me force close error. yet i am not giving low rating to this app becuse i know this is very good app and i trust on you that as soon as possible you people will solve this issue.
6826	5	a	Keeps track of my study without being over complicated or clustered. Charts are always great to see how much study is being done and where to focus your efforts next. Little bit crashy when it comes to reopening the app but nothing serious. I recommend!
6827	1	a	Its not the same 😤😟😤😤😤😥😥
6828	1	a	It doesn't have Remo songs and no new songs of Tamil.   ..
6829	1	a	3 popup ads in one minute
6830	1	a	You've got to pay for full version to get settings they claim here.
6831	5	a	But once I played around is doing exactly what I want. The zero permissions thing is a big plus in my book too. A very useful app.
6832	5	a	the programme is working good.
6833	4	a	I like the but some thig is wrong
6834	3	a	Previše priprost interface, dodajte još neku boju i biće savršena, ovako jako nezamislivo izgleda
6835	5	a	Very good, But can not write paragraph transparent on the picture. No any update long more time. Need option select word for color change. So Pls pay attention and thanks.
6836	1	a	worst tower defense game EVER... insanely difficult to complete levels... dont waste ur time
6837	1	a	I was playing and all the sudden the scream said diediedie and my phone was vibrating so I got scared don't try this it will freak u out ...
6838	1	a	It is not at all like real mendicot.
6839	5	a	So far. I think this app will give me what I want as per dreams interpretations
6840	5	a	I just have to much time to wast.
6841	5	a	Works great, easy to use. Perfect for editing the boring parts of cell \nphone vids before posting to social media. Love it! -Update, still love it \n21/6/2018
6842	3	a	The apps ok but the screen gets dark after a few seconds
6843	5	a	I tried using my tablet's camera to take photos of some projects that I have worked on, but immediately noticed that they were too dark. so I went looking for an app that would eliminate that, and I found this one, tried it a couple times. I just have to say that the difference was night and day!
6844	4	a	Not sure what happened. After years of using the app, it just stopped working. All I get is a neverending loading screen when I try to log in.
6845	5	a	This game is amazing it's like in real life any color any style bananas choclate it's the best make up game
6846	5	a	I have a problem .. can u please put more levels .. then it'll be alot cooler .. but love the game ...
6847	1	a	Please let us delete this from our phones. I have no use for it. I also have no use for a great number of things I'm forced to have on my phone now. I have an 8.0 GB phone. These forced apps take up over 6.0 GB of it. I understand there are things the phone needs in order to run, but these apps are not one of them.                            I don't want to have to jail break my cell. Someone please pass this message along to who ever makes these decisions.
6848	1	a	Poor idea Poor game Poor graphix
6849	4	a	I downloaded this then it wouldn't be on the home screen 😦 plz fix this I will leave 5 stars 🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒
6850	4	a	The TITLE of my review is my FIRST FEELING after installing this App. The fifth star is due unless I experience it properly.
6851	5	a	I download this app because of FIRST KISS. 😊
6852	5	a	It was so fun, im addicted to this wonderful game, its just like a digital \ndoll house, its so good, you can control a bunch of characters and go \ndiffrent places
6853	1	a	Installed but does not work....uninstalled it..
6854	1	a	Crashes when picking an image
6855	1	a	Oh god,i installed it n nw its not showing,wt should I do??please helppp!!!!,useless!
6856	5	a	So amazing!♥  I use this application!nice
6857	1	a	" the keys rearrange and I find I have to hunt for the keys which slows me down.  My phone is big so it is like holding a tablet in my left hand while trying to type with my right hand. It took me way too long just to type this rating! Uninstalling."""
6858	1	a	I do not have access to most of my files, all I need to do is transfer music to my phone and I can't because YOUR app doesn't show that file, your effort in this app in this is horrible, re-do it, until then I'm NEVER downloading again.
6859	3	a	They should upgrade more, technology is going fast now.
6860	1	a	Talan az angol telefonom miatt, de sajnos nem sikerult jegyet vasarolnom. Igy kritikam erre vonatkozik, felig angol, felig magyar menure. Tobb logikatlan lepes, mint pl utas hozzaadaskor Item elnevezesu rublikaba nevet kell irni. Ha tobb jegyet vennek, ures mezore kell klikkelni, majd hozzaadja, de kivenni mar nem lehet. A Selecting...arra utal, hogy varjak, de arra kell klikkelni hogy kivalasszam mit szeretnek stb. A vegen error, igy marad a jegyiroda. Remelem a jovoben tudom majd hasznalni.
6861	1	a	No just no dude THIS IS WORSE THAN JONES BBQ AND FOOT MASSGE I CANT SEE NOTHING IM LEGALLY BLIND IN THIS GAME SON ALL I SEE ARE THESE DUMB TRESS AND KEEP WALKING IN THIS THANG U CALL WOODS!!!!!!
6862	1	a	Utroligt at man stadig ikke kan gennemføre betaling. Er I overhovedet interesseret i andet end iPhone brugere?
6863	5	a	Such a beauty theme, I love this..
6864	3	a	Unde-s alea 1001??? Daca sunt 50 e bine
6865	4	a	الفترة الاخيرة مايرضى يشتغل التطبيق يظل يقول فشل العمليه ليش كدا؟؟؟؟؟
6866	3	a	This is kool..now I just have to learn how to play them..
6867	1	a	Leaderboards crashed restarted device 7 times.  Finally deleted it and reinstalled then it deleted progress. Really?
6868	5	a	This is a lot of cool things to do on this game
6869	1	a	Um aplicativo que não funciona, apenas.
6870	3	a	You should take away that thing that comes up when you are in the parking spot
6871	5	a	It is cool thx cookie clickers
6872	2	a	Overall it's playable so long as one turns off the sound and ignores the slow delay in click for mouse movement the wait for mouse to move which lacks interaction that distract from game play. Even the stage winning sounds are missed placed.
6873	5	a	Wish there were more like it in different colors!
6874	5	a	I've tried several similar apps (paid included) and this one suits me best. Clean interface, lots of customization, you can view your records all at once or sorted by categories, including favorites across different categories. One small gripe: when you edit fields inside a record, it would be nice if there was an option to reorder them - move up/down.
6875	5	a	This game is really nice for small kids
6876	4	a	I love this app.It is very useful.I can view all my statements,balance enquiry without any issue.it will be more useful.it will be more useful if there is a net banking option.even though am pretty much satisfied without this application.UPDATE required.
6877	5	a	I like it soooooo much that I play it with my sister
6878	2	a	In my phone, LG F520K, this app doesn't work. It cannot sence my USB drive, Sandisk dual usb. :(
6879	4	a	Seems the push notifications have gone, looks a bit pixely around the edges but then again I haven't found a better retro app than this :)
6880	4	a	Can you add the mountain chorus frog please?
6881	4	a	I love everything about this app except that it does not include the processes of the bones. Other than that, fantastic app!
6882	5	a	Eine richtige IT Zeitung. Für jeden ist etwas dabei. Und die Werbung hält \nsich in Grenzen.
6883	1	a	HATE ITTTTTT STUPID AND IDIOT GAME THUMS DOWN 🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🤔
6884	5	a	I use Dorchester subway sometimes twice a week the staff are so friendly and always know what my order will be without asking...
6885	2	a	I LOVE this game so far. It's cute and stands out a bit from other farm games, however I can't visit other farms or roadsides. From the other reviews it looks like this is common. Will probably end up uninstalling.
6886	5	a	It's perfectly don for you
6887	5	a	It is so cute to see hazel and her baby brother matt hanging with each other in the kitchen
6888	5	a	Really fun once you actually know the perspective and the precisive play with the game.......you all should download it and I love it so much and have a great time playing this game......take my advice and play this game
6889	5	a	Well revamped and decades old famous app ;-) love it for it's collection
6890	5	a	This is a good game because I love hospital games!!!!
6891	5	a	The best of all puzzle games on the store - addictive and fun for girls and boys
6892	4	a	Hello Mr. Fredrik. Can you please put a number of moves the player did and the perfect number of moves. Thanks
6893	1	a	The clocks look pretty, but over the last three days I've tried to reset the clock a number of times, but it consistently loses 7/8 minutes over the course of the day.  What is the point of a clock that doesn't tell the time! !!!!!!
6894	2	a	Has nothing to do with black holes
6895	5	a	Someone sent in a bad review saying it does not work on their HTC Desire HD. I don't know what they are doing wrong but it works perfectly fine on mine. Fantastic app guys THANK YOU ******!!!!!****
6896	2	a	They are trieng to make a fun game with coping sub way surfers because evry body loved that game so if evry body liked this game they wooldput a mony way so they could get rich by the way it's realy boring!!!!!!!!!
6897	1	a	The game plays well, but I can't find a way to top-up when the money has run out.   Surely there's a way to start again...
6898	5	a	Fun graphics. I really like the bluetooth hookup to play against my wife. It worked nicely on our Galaxy Tablets. Nice job guys!
6899	1	a	This is theft. The original game is tank in action. I don't know how you could make it a mobile game.
6900	4	a	Seems fun - I hope it dont end with the need to purchase anything to continue playing! That would be zero stars.
6901	2	a	When I get to level 28 it freezes and some dont go with pics
6902	3	a	why not give the 5 pink chests, why do we have to buy them? I think it's a bunch of sh**.
6903	5	a	This app made checking all my answers so much easier. I am very pleased with it. $0.99 well worth it.
6904	5	a	T H I S  Is  A M A Z I N G
6905	3	a	Crashes often while switching tabs
6906	1	a	App is not woring //  stuck !
6907	3	a	Cool but needs more pics  Cool
6908	5	a	Love it,it actually works you can feel it too
6909	5	a	Different from other games but better game play I think. 3d graphics and sound are nice. On line tournaments is a good idea. Well worth it
6910	4	a	But it was entertaining and well made. No glitches that I found. Puzzels were easy enough for tweens to accomplish.
6911	5	a	Quite an original idea though one improvement I would like to see introduced is the ability to resize widgets and/or have multiple widgets on a single page (the 'thin' widgets make a lot of wasted space).  Overall I would definitely recommend it even in it's current state.
6912	5	a	Is agood app in  traval chennai city
6913	5	a	Every cheetah rider should have this app....Keep it up MAHINDRA
6914	4	a	Works well but dbase not extended, waiting for the next clean food load
6915	3	a	I like this game, but it often changed your answers from bills to money (on the board) then bills comes up and you don't get credit. Some questions I've gotten three times on the same day, and once I got the exact same questions all the way through fast money in back to back games. I love the game but it would be nice if they were constantly mixing in new questions. Still gonna play.
6916	5	a	Дуже гарна гра, дитина вивчила абетку за тиждень. За два тижні дитина знудилася, шукаю гру для навчання читання.
6917	3	a	I liked it untill the recent update that restricted it to just \n/r/earthporn. Now I cannot select what type of images to view.
6918	1	a	I can't I Don't Know How To Play The  Game I Wish It Would Die
6919	5	a	It helps me a lot, very professional look and feel.
6920	5	a	My preferred Speed/ Ping/ Packet Error testing tool.  Be sure to disable the automatically scheduled Tests.
6921	1	a	It was the worst game I have ever played I just didn't enjoy it at all
6922	3	a	This game was fun for sure but it definitely needed more work. I got a bug sometimes where I would auto run left and another where the jump button wouldn't work, but not often. Not being able to save my progress was my biggest gripe. Improve on these things and the next game will be grand.
6923	1	a	It is not good  it really  sucks  hate it don't like it because one it doesn't let me load and go to the game
6924	5	a	Overall an exciting game to kill time and increase information side by \nside. Thumbs up👍
6925	5	a	It's very fun play it pls :3 maybe a cat will change your mind (;
6926	2	a	Why did they make it
6927	5	a	Pretty good idea for live wallpaper, really cool.
6928	5	a	Exactly what I was looking for.  Simple to use,  low system resources.  What more could you ask for? Thank you developers.
6929	5	a	I love this game and I am only 10
6930	4	a	Indian currency is being displayed in hindi. Please change to English numerals. Love the simplicity of the app :-D
6931	3	a	The recorder is seriously worth 5 star rating, but I'd rate it only 3 because of the disability to share it on other apps. Whenever I try sharing on whatsapp or messenger, it says that THE FILE FORMAT IS NOT SUPPORTED. If this issue is from your end, please make the recordings shareable and if the error is on my end, let me know.
6932	4	a	Good game to keep your self ociepied
6933	1	a	Liked it better as a free app. 0.99 isn't much, but I would have preferred it up front, instead of in the middle of trying to calculate a drip rate. Thanks!
6934	5	a	Bizarrely, for the first time in three years, I woke up, switched my phone on and went about my day an hour ahead of actual time 😂 I googled and someone recommended this app. Eventually, I went into clock settings and the automatic thingie wasn't on - D'OH! So now phone is on the right time but am keeping this app as back up because the trust between my phone and myself has been compromised...
6935	4	a	It's good just one thing is there a way you guys can add an option so I can move the app to my SD card?
6936	3	a	CAN SOME ONE TELL ME HOW TO OPERATE THIS? IM USING SAMSUNG GALAXY SIII
6937	3	a	"I can't figure out how to apply the snowglobe I chose. Needs to have a specific \apply globe\"" button."""
6938	4	a	Exactly what I've been searching for! Appropriate workouts, the fact that you can see an actual video wowed me.
6939	5	a	This is a great way to practice for your theory test. I passed my exam today and the questions here were very similar to the real one. I also read and practice online too. Good luck
6940	4	a	Cool theme I liked it very much. Thank you.
6941	5	a	This is simply THE application for using the GPS functionality on your phone. It has everything from compass to gps, maps, waypoints, routes, etc. It even gives you the option of taking a photo with metadata about the location and angle at which the photo was taken. This is absolutely great for finding your way around as well as later documentation of your travels.
6942	3	a	I really like thus app,it scared my sister and my brothers
6943	2	a	I used to love having this widget on my home screen but since over a month now I'm not seeing new words. Just the same word from over a month back. What's more annoying is that the calendar date against the words keep updating.  Please fix this or I'm just going to uninstall and find another widget.
6944	1	a	Why would you pay for this?
6945	5	a	Gorgeous scenes, but the 3d is not working. Still loved it.
6946	1	a	Says no manual settings work on my phone so far I have used everything excepts manual focus
6947	2	a	It used to work but everything else seems to work
6948	5	a	More levels and more spaceships
6949	2	a	Would love to use this on me phone but somehow it's not allowing me too.. wrong pin/vc code than wrong email address please make it simple for the likes of me \u003e no computer wiz here \u003c   I have account with you/greyhound there should be somehow a link up straight away but finding it hard to sign in on phone.  maybe its me not you but I want to use this app but am deny access..
6950	5	a	This app is like my bro
6951	5	a	I love it, however I have been getting an error message and reinstalled it and now it won't install. I'll keep trying. Otherwise, it's beautiful.
6952	5	a	This was my favorite theme on my BlackBerry. (Buufgant i think it was called)  It is truely wonderful to have it again, tons of great icons in the theme itself,  not even counting the awesome icon packs,  i gladly made a donation
6953	1	a	CHEATERS. THEY DON'T LET ME DO STUFF BUT THE DO IT THERE SELF
6954	1	a	It was so laggy, it crashed my phone, some of the blocks are locked, and why can you not fly?
6955	2	a	It does not select photo from gallery
6956	5	a	I love gazhal and this app helps to collect those singers ghazals i listen name only like begum akhtar
6957	5	a	City Ankholya churu rajsthan Mr bhiwaram Dhaka jat boys
6958	1	a	I am not able to play game as it says unable to login please check network connection.... Though the connection is perfect I downloaded the game through internet connection but while sign in it says no connection
6959	5	a	I played it on the computer and now I'm playing it on tablet i think it's a good game but to many adds can u fix that plz!
6960	5	a	It is very convenient and easy app, torch light is also very bright
6961	5	a	I thought it was awesome most games on my phone makes it freeze but this didn't
6962	5	a	تطبيق جميل لكن اظم صوتي لصوت الاخ يوسف العزيز ان التطبيق ينقصة سداد يمن موبايل وكذلك تسديد فواتير النت باي مبلغ
6963	5	a	its alright..just needs more finishing touches like putting new rims and kits..
6964	5	a	I think this apps can be usefull to my kids.
6965	5	a	It's like so much fun, I love it 5 stars awesome
6966	2	a	The game is very amazing and interesting in every ways but whelp I can't play anymore. It always stuck at 45% and now I am still hoping to wait and so I can play again. It's been months. Please I LOVE this lovely and cool game please when can I play it again? (っ˘̩╭╮˘̩)っ
6967	5	a	برنامه خوبیه فقط باید گسترده تر شه
6968	1	a	When I was opening the app It just stops I tired with it please fix
6969	5	a	This is the meaning of drift
6970	5	a	You dun goofed and killed evrybody. What a great hook
6971	5	a	Guij bna mini hair hen be
6972	5	a	I love this game I whant to dive in real life
6973	3	a	I have had several people tell me that Fluenz is a great way to learn a new language.  However, I think the company must be dying.  The app hasn't been updated in over too years.  The website is over a year old as well.  This is sad because I think Rosetta Stone and Pimsleur both need some competition.  RIP Fluenz...
6974	2	a	Game still won't start on my galaxy s3, it exits after I just start the app. Please fix this because I've played the game on my old phone and thought it was awesome and now I want to play on my new phone. I hope you fix this in the near future, thank you.
6975	1	a	big name but not a big aap. Its just very bad. what is jang group doing now a days. They have to be up to date. I am going to remove this app now. Just uninstall this app so quick as possible. Jung group is not interested to do any thing to improve the quality.
6976	4	a	This game is cute and fun.. I give four stars because the time should be a little longer considering we don't know where the key is until we move first...! Great game to pass time!
6977	1	a	Wat a waste of data technology.
6978	5	a	This is a good game its graphics are good and levels are awesome
6979	1	a	Very disappointed.  Does not work on either my Galaxy Note 5 nor my Android tablet.
6980	4	a	Acik unuttun mu yandin 1 saate telefonun sarji bitip kapaniyor. Bunun harici basarili gayet
6981	5	a	Those who only like pics but not the words I want them to know education comes first not detail
6982	5	a	We have to buy brovision card?
6983	2	a	Paid for full version to use my watch and get rid of annoying ads... Doesn't connect to watch and still has annoying ads
6984	5	a	Aplikasi yang sangat membantu utk melawan media Mainstream
6985	5	a	Two big problems with the app were patched within 24 hours of commenting. Well done, THAT'S service!
6986	2	a	The game sometimes refuses to let you move material to a winning stance. Therefore you can never win this game. It is a fraud... Not worth playing.. Practice is OK, however it will never let you win according to the rules..
6987	3	a	Too Dark or would have rated higher.
6988	4	a	Uselesssssssssss app it's not coming when we type I suggest don't install This and took many ads like too many it's too small pad nonsense app
6989	5	a	It is very good but try tron legacy game to create please
6990	1	a	man, i cannot download the beat, it consumes a lot of data, why cant i just \nplay it offline?
6991	1	a	At best the only parts of this app that seem to work are just links to other recipe sites. Complete crap!
6992	3	a	It would be perfect except for a free  wallpaper you have to buy the full version! Not free then!!!
6993	4	a	on my cp its an android and when I open the game I see a 1000 gems but on my ipad no gems so why that happen?and also so many ad is showing that mini carnival thing I hate that
6994	3	a	I hate Hindus but because Muslims are also settled in India so India is good but Indians never love Pakistan. I really hate Hindu and their culture.
6995	1	a	App works fine, but because the drivers are self employed the company can't \nplan their pick-ups. Been stranded on more than one occasion having booked \nthe journey well over 12 hours in advance. !!
6996	5	a	This has been on my wishlist for a while, and I finally got it! Zero regrets on this one! The detail is beautiful, and I love how you can scroll around the entire room. You can even interact with certain items! Now if only I could go up those stairs....
6997	3	a	My son really liked it a lot but, like with everything that's repetitive, kids get bored.
6998	1	a	I hate that game it keeps closing😠😠😤😤😡😡👿👿
6999	3	a	I think this app helps me a lot when I don't understand a word
7000	5	a	I love this game, but I wish the leaning in the shopping cart was more sensitive, so the tilting would be faster. MONKEY BIDNESS IS AWESOME.
7001	1	a	Does not work at all.  Will not even come up.  Keeps freezing up.
7002	5	a	Works well in France and Germany.
7003	5	a	Simple UI very nice.. i really like it.
7004	5	a	Great game if you know about fishing
7005	4	a	It is definitely challenging with the time element working against your \nword formation.
7006	5	a	Best game ive ever played. Im only giving it 9/10 because parking mania is better.\tDownload duty bus driver.
7007	3	a	Needs different camera angles. It really isn't that hard to fix, just please come back to this game nimblebit and make the simple change and this would be SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better. (Maybe adjust the par on certain objects). If you fix these things, this might be the next big game.
7008	4	a	I think this is sick but please can you stop the constant flickering light on the side put apart from that it is an amazing app everyone should get it and an applause for the creators
7009	5	a	Ok, i'm not that high-tech, but i will tell you that this app DOES work. Iv transfered from my lg Volt to my Galaxy Tab 4. I tried GTA San Andreas...the file transferes, but not the data, but video, music, photos and non-obb file apps have ALWAYS worked
7010	5	a	Allah razi olsun. Biz faydalandikca sevabi sana da ulassin.
7011	1	a	Why can't pple have the mind of creating something by imagination and creation ?? Why do dey need to copy others? If the makers of the game did not copy others i am sure it would have been better. I would have rated it 5 stars if not 4 copying !!!
7012	1	a	I think the boat was to slow turning and I don't think that arrow pointed to your place that you need to I was 👎 not good
7013	5	a	The most useful app I got, allows me to save entire web comics to my device for offline web viewing
7014	1	a	To many videos in between holes
7015	3	a	Support guide says to change password after connecting to camera but does not say how to do that. Very concerned that other people are watching my camera as it turns on randomly. Any help would be appreciated!
7016	2	a	I wish I could use my notes now that they are in my dropbox!  Sheesh... This app is so much better on a IOS device.  And I really love this app.  I have a Note 8 and when I click out to take a photo or do anything else it stops recording in the backround.  I don't want it to stop.  Please fix this.
7017	5	a	Works great and very easy. Very recommended!
7018	2	a	I was using the app just fine but it logged me out and will not allow me to log back in. I deleted the app and reinstalled it but it still didn't work.
7019	4	a	Ở bản đầu tiên có hiện trong list app khi bấm share nhưng ở các lần nâng cấp sau khg thấy nữa, phải vào app, chọn ảnh rồi mới hide được. Tôi đang dùng trên android L.
7020	5	a	Graphical user interface needs alot of improvements
7021	5	a	Naman, and the Price of course, the Facebook page. If you are looking for a while. I'm not sure if this is a bit of a new one. To be honest
7022	3	a	I removed my sim and inserted another one . Its just showing a pop up message . Bt didn't get any message.for my alternate num. Then how can we find if he neglects the pop up message.  And some options are not working properly.
7023	1	a	Hello, My Name Is YOUR MOM
7024	3	a	It's a good game but you will be asked to buy if you want to carry on levels are too short
7025	5	a	App molto comoda ... fa il suo dovere!
7026	4	a	I would  rate this give stars,  ut the thing is that it just doesent last for more than a couple days! Pretty cute by the way😉
7027	5	a	So Beautiful very shinny pinky color.wondering wonderful, appreciate for the studio or owner mades  I am praise to you. Thanks so much,
7028	5	a	So Nice But it's only card maker😎😊
7029	3	a	This is a great app, but keeps glitching , and I have to uninstall, so I lose progress. I can set it kind of where in was, but it's trial and error. I usually remember how much time there was between lozenges. I was using it to wean myself off of losenges, not cigarettes.
7030	5	a	Amazing app: simple and pretty effective.
7031	3	a	Really fun to play around with, but it goes names. It could use work. Like how so many ads pop up for such a small app. I don't get it!!! Waste of storage. Good for a 8 year old. But it is SUPER inaccurate!
7032	1	a	It is trash all it does is go in the wrong direction it sucks
7033	5	a	A very useful tool for when you dont feel like using an online dictionary.
7034	5	a	I was skeptical about getting this game for my phone but it's been out for 14 years and phones nowadays are pretty strong. I'm running Kotor on my Samsung Galaxy S7 and it runs perfectly. The controls are smooth and very simple. The graphics are crisp and very beautiful. This game brings back so many memories I really look forward to a possible Kotor 2 for mobile! Keep up the great work!
7035	2	a	I want to play it but the screen has at least two layers and you can't scroll, it's really a strobe light affect, WARNING NOT FOR PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY
7036	2	a	When I'm in my room or out, it freezes
7037	5	a	Need more themes like this
7038	1	a	This game is nothing more but a bunch of stolen assets from other games.  The map is from wreckfest, and the cars come straight out of mafia 2.
7039	4	a	I don't have a gyroscope on my phone but if you take your time it works fine!
7040	5	a	Mr. Ritesh kawadkar lay bhari app ahe. Avadal apalyala. Jhakkas.
7041	5	a	For those of you who think you want to Halloween theme but really just want pop-up advertisements without being able to change or activate anything this is the theme for you enjoy it, five stars
7042	4	a	I love this I really do but I hate that I can't touch our see her skirt our legs to lower half of her body and when I touch her chest she blocks I want that fixed do that I'll rate 5 stars miku deserves this upgrade do it 4 miku
7043	4	a	I love this app. It is everything I need. The only thing I would like to see is the capability to manually edit the label text. Thanks. Great job. Jack
7044	1	a	It says it allows you to extract zip files with password which is totally false.Dont download this app.
7045	5	a	I think it will be Nice game
7046	2	a	I have to constantly sync my library because all my songs keep disappearing. One song I downloaded isn't even the correct song for the title??? Wish I could get my money back
7047	5	a	This game is so cool but slender man can do better it is really not scary who ever made this though it deserves 5 stars
7048	1	a	It's not working at all!!
7049	1	a	The dam game doesn't ever start up
7050	1	a	This game sucks balls to mch ads
7051	5	a	Love it saves time and very quik
7052	2	a	Nice game but there r no left right driving key.. so it's poor game.
7053	5	a	Siempre fuí un paquete en geografía, y gracias a esta aplicación al fin estoy consiguiendo subsanar esa carencia. Divertida y perfecta para echar los ratos de esperar el bus.
7054	1	a	This app isn't good. The least you could do is not charge
7055	5	a	Glad to see the update of the Android version! Works smoothly on my newer phone.
7056	5	a	Thats the game i wanted ... For so long.... Every thing is well programmed.... U guys just nailed it
7057	5	a	Love reading it very informative...thank you so much to the developers for creating such thing;)
7058	1	a	App won't let me select a preferred store.
7059	1	a	The app has a decent gui it looks like my original remote but it does not work for my TV. Brand new 75 inch samsung smart tv. I will just stick to samsung watch on for my remote app it works well
7060	5	a	awesome app thanx to developer(s)
7061	4	a	I use this as an app for my volunteer group. USGS calls are on point and I love the wiki descriptions. Two problems, though: 1. Spadefoot and Great Plains Toad links are switched around. 2. Needs Apple support.
7062	2	a	I needed to wait an hour (maybe more) to load the game and when it finally made it, the application did not even work because i was on the iPad.  If you can sort it out, i might be able to give a better rate but right now only 2
7063	5	a	Great concept and infinite customization. I can play levels over until I am ready to advance. Thank you for great game. Will try others by same developer.
7064	4	a	But most music and bgm are missing. My favorite is arjuna meet his traupathi bgm....please upload
7065	1	a	When I go to last one add everytime then when I cancel the add it comes from start just hate I am un installing this game
7066	1	a	Previous version of app was the best. Why did you people updated it? It's not at all nice now. Please change back to previous version. It was very easy to search channels before. Now whichever channel name we give in search box it says not available. Sorry uninstalling
7067	1	a	Non funziona, ferma al loading screen
7068	5	a	San po pag bigyan nyo po akong ma install to..kasi po maganda to at gustong gusto ko
7069	4	a	I like it alot i use to write my thoughts and it helps me
7070	5	a	Saya punya dah ok..saya uninstall dulu lepas tu saya downld blik baru boleh \ndengar..
7071	5	a	Just now installed, in short viewing seems very fantastic app. Download \u0026 enjoy mp
7072	2	a	She's only 2 and she LOVES it  and when I'm not with her she can get things  with my MONEY. That's  bad😐👶
7073	3	a	I'd give it 5* if you had all the same dates from a previous phone I've lost everything
7074	5	a	I loved it, it is good for sleep and I do believe there is a music option.
7075	1	a	I watched ads to unlock polishes for my daughter, but it seems the most recent update locked them back up and decided to charge for what I've already earned. Will be uninstalling.
7076	5	a	Just force closes saying license isn't available even though I've purchased it. EDIT: Dec 7th 2016, the author has updated the game and is working (applies to XHD aswell). Took a while for it to be updated but all in all, it works.  Thanks dev :)
7077	5	a	It is a awesome fighting game but slow
7078	3	a	The riddles r quite hard there r not anouth powerups
7079	1	a	9/18/2018: a total failure that doesn't even run on Android 8.1.
7080	1	a	I've downloaded this one but can't apply in my zenfone 2
7081	5	a	Love balancing the crates ...very challenging :)
7082	1	a	The game just makes me cringe. It's so boring.
7083	2	a	It force closes a lot. I do mean all the time.  Can we also have longer than 5 seconds.  Makes it impossible to take your own photos. I would like to upgrade but I have read  the reviews and don't think it would be wise. I have tried the others and this one is far better. If it didn't force close all THE TIME
7084	4	a	I'm not sure why other users are asking for more features-if you want bells this isn't the app for you. It's designed simple for a reason. You can plan days and weeks ahead in your calendar- this app is meant to keep you focused on today and tomorrow. Just brain dump and move what didn't get done that day to the next.
7085	1	a	Rubbish the turning is rubbish
7086	1	a	Vad är detta för app? Att gå in på hemsidan via telefonen är smidigare än denna appen, det känns väldigt oseriöst och slappt. Och man kan inte döpa sin app till Mina Sidor, alla har mina sidor, ni är inte ensamma.
7087	3	a	" beat all in game content already."""
7088	5	a	Finaly a kaito model! Now all it needs its a gakupo one :D
7089	4	a	Fun, newish concept and nice levels. Only downsides are  ads coming sometimes in the middle of a level and endless mode bugging after night 10-11, spawning no heroes at all and giving me levels and gold for nothing :)
7090	5	a	Not sure accurate or not, but shape n size in ge seems correct. If you cant keyin file name for kml during export, just type as normal n choose ok/save. File will be in the directory. The bug only make file name tht you type invisible during typing
7091	1	a	"It will show dreadful and cryptic \An Error Has Accured\"" when searching for particular vehicle (minivan in this case) but will show correct vehicle   as available when vehicle type is not selected.  Also \""Modify Search\""  button on error page loops back to the error page without chances to change anything.   Uninstalled."""
7092	5	a	Works well although description is a bit unclear.
7093	5	a	Very addictive. Definetly 5 stars
7094	5	a	Awesome i am spell bound.
7095	3	a	I love this game, but all of a sudden I went to play it and the picture won't show up anymore. It's just a blank screen with sound. Is this fixable? I really enjoy this game and would like to keep playing
7096	3	a	الحمد الله اللذي جعلتني مسلمين
7097	5	a	Really informative for me. I like it
7098	5	a	" just try it out and thank me later"""
7099	2	a	Using on samsung gal tablet by way of tmobile data hotspot device, s/b 4g lte. All the app can read is my device info. Please advise
7100	1	a	The next time someone makes a game like this, make shore that there is an English!
7101	5	a	Both CM Security and Norton Mobile Security detected it!
7102	2	a	It is no longer working for me. I changed my phone to the ATRIX 2,and it is now too small and off center on my screen. The lanterns also glitch. Very sad as this was one of my faves...
7103	5	a	It‘s worked well on my tablet.. thank you very much
7104	5	a	Would like mythos cards also. ;-)
7105	1	a	Bkwas hy Huawei me hota hi ni
7106	1	a	I've never been able to log in. Server is not available to process log in. 😕
7107	5	a	Works great. Use it with Smart Action when insert usb charge for nighttime clock. Great job.
7108	4	a	Another excellent game from Glu. Great graphics, but the fight mechanic has been used many times before- at least it's polished and reads your action correctly 99% of the time. Fights a very hard and money is hard to accumulate, but then again this is like all their games. Just keep grinding.

7110	5	a	This is a magic. Thanx for it. Really it's work too good.
7111	4	a	A very challenging mining  game that is interesting to play. See how many different gems that you can collect without running out of energy. You also have to watch the temperature and not get too many gems at one time to carry out.
7112	1	a	hated this app it won't show up anywhere
7113	1	a	I am very angry on this aap
7114	5	a	Too apt too precise... On the jouney back to my college...I became a philosopher
7115	5	a	Great game. I'm ready for the casino
7116	4	a	I absolutely adore this game, and the other games in its series. However, with this one there simply isn't enough content. What's there is simply flawless, but it needs more guns. I would suggest that you add weapons such as the Gewehr M.95, the Gewehr M98, the Lewis gun, the Lee Enfield Mk. 3, the Lüger, the C96, the C93, and other WW1 era guns. I beg this of you.
7117	3	a	That 3 stars only for that idea . That feature I need  But It doesn't working😑
7118	5	a	Very great just need record button
7119	5	a	Need background to blur like in pictures. Otherwise it's awesome.
7120	1	a	I try to put in my folder but it wont show up anywhere don't get it on Alcatel One touch it sucks like poop 💩
7121	2	a	How does it work? I scheduled a visit and could not see or hear the other person? Someone please explain!!!! I do not dislike it but I don't know how it works.
7122	1	a	За окнами ни облачка. Это приложение с утра показывает дождь на целый день. Google показывает более достоверные сведения.
7123	5	a	I can never get to level 103! I've passed level 102 and still it won't let me move on!!
7124	1	a	WHY WASTE MY TIME DESCRIBING YOU ARE SHAMELESS ATTITUDE
7125	5	a	Fantastic! I really had a moment of stunned silence when I opened this.
7126	5	a	I love this because cats are better than dogs and i really really like kitties
7127	1	a	Not playing on my Samsung Galaxy note2
7128	3	a	It's OK,,, I've seen better,, plus free ones!!!.
7129	5	a	Imran sir I have seen your apps. Those are fantastic and educative also.
7130	3	a	I had to update and lower my review, this was great to start but they have not done any updates what so ever, all they need to make this app great is to allow us to categorize and to allow us to alphabetize our products and this will be a perfect inventory tracker.  I love how you have 0 permissions, keep this just an inventory tracker and add the alphabetizing and categorizing and this will be 5 stars.. you may also want to allow barcode scanning to make things much simpler but not if you need permissions
7131	4	a	Perfect for basic use.  Works as advertised.  Recommend you use a space instead of a comma for value sep.  Thanks.
7132	4	a	I love this app. It would get a fifth star from me though if it gave you Middle Earth men names because I am useless at thinking up unusual human names. Still. If you don't download then you are most definitely missing out :-)
7133	4	a	Many variety to choose from
7134	5	a	The application is very good and helpful in our day to day problems. It is a remedy for our problems we face in our lives.
7135	1	a	wont let you select a different drive. my videos are on a sd card. says it \nsupports avi video, but anytime I try to select a video the app closes on \nme. tried 5x, rebooted my phone and tried another 3x. same thing. \nuninstalled.
7136	5	a	This is an amasing app and lots of fun for childen
7137	1	a	WON'T LET ME USE A PHOTO FOR BACKGRPUND.
7138	1	a	Soon as you connect to server app stops and closes with an error negotiate 5 stars would be a better rating
7139	4	a	So the only bug I've seen, that is really frustrating, is when making your own gamepad layout the analogs get stuck facing upwards, so I'm left using a premade layout. Also a RESIZE of buttons PLEASE!! It would make this app perfect! But other than that this connects perfect and doesn't lag on dolphin or ppsspp on PC, seriously this gamepad is awesome, and thank you for implementing such a great control mapping! I'm surprised such a good application is free. 4 stars now, but with added tweaks DEF 5 stars.
7140	4	a	This is a good game, although it can get boring and easy. Also, I want to \nbe able to custimize my crocs. The graphics should be more realistic. There \nare no glitches. And can you make a cougar simulator? That would be great.
7141	3	a	There times when it gives u like 3 consecutive wins and it stops
7142	1	a	Too big app to keep.
7143	4	a	Tapi letak tombol back ketutupan iklan
7144	3	a	Nothing special and ads on startup are very annoying.
7145	3	a	Thanks the calendar is boldly illustrated.
7146	5	a	My favourite.. keep on with your exellent performance
7147	4	a	Works well, but taking up 1GB which seems excessive. It would be helpful if you could pick a primary with backups for each timeslot, as well as have a visual view of the schedule (this is Tableau, after all!).
7148	4	a	Paid to remove ads but I'm still getting them.
7149	2	a	I can't hear it at all with my phone, even when I turn my volume up to the highest possible voulme. Also, it would be better if they had a section where you could learn the alphabet, so it would make learning so much better. Also, if you made the pronouncers for the phrases go slower, it would be easier to understand. Also, if there was a dictionary included in this app that could translate English phrases into amhatic, then that would be so much better.
7150	5	a	Great app for us really help a lot in prayer
7151	4	a	Simple but fun and not too easy
7152	3	a	Pretty good pretty good the toy airplane sounds more like a fart when you touch it though! 😐😬
7153	5	a	It is very good app .try it once
7154	2	a	Unless you know the name or colloquialisms of the item you can't find it.  This app needs a feature search such 3 leaves, or 5 leaves, red hairy vine or smooth....
7155	3	a	I am Loving the Game,but do to the Apps that keep popping up and the one that keeps flashing at the bottom of the screen it's going to be removed from my phone it's giving me Headaches.
7156	2	a	The annyoing thing is that one that everybody already knows which spoil the all game experience and other is that airplanes are colliding with others which aren't on the screen.
7157	5	a	Since I hate studying but this makes it feel like playing
7158	4	a	But have too small game
7159	2	a	Can even save videos in gallery from drone
7160	5	a	I love it because the game was good and the car game was good fantastic
7161	1	a	Latest version puts adware in notification bar.
7162	4	a	I am using Samsung s6 edge my smart manager is detecting this app as a threat  and malware , it always shows it in a notification bar , fix this bug as soon as possible
7163	2	a	I use to play this on an old desktop in the 90s. Sadly, the game controls on this game don't work. I only get the look around option. No movement controls show up. Kinda disappointed.
7164	5	a	This app is very gorgeous and nicely designed. The prayer's are lovely and take you to a place of peace and serenity.  I recommend this app for anyone who wants to bring spirituality into their lives. God bless you.
7165	1	a	This app doesn't work. It doesn't let you connect the components laid out. No user manual or Help is available to see how to use it.
7166	5	a	Perfect for reading school emails where they come as docx. Don't really need it for much other than plain text so can't comment on other things.
7167	3	a	Every time I open my phone or tablet it tells me unfortunately the Despicable Me 2 wedge is being forced to close.
7168	4	a	It's working nice.but i can't write in telugu letter ట and డ.how to write this letters.plzzz tel me
7169	1	a	First of all interrupting game play with ads? And palm trees then what laser fire from space?
7170	5	a	this game is gud i like dream up
7171	2	a	Used to be a great game. Now you have to pay to unlock levels. Would rather stick to temple run.
7172	1	a	Obviously the creators of this game could care less about helping. I just downloaded the game and I am having the same problem people had a year ago. You cannot post anything to sell, keeps telling me to update, I go to other farms and I'm told I lost connection. Really if you make a game a care less about fixing the problems then don't waste people's time making it available to play. Oh and if you email fgor help, you get no response either.
7173	5	a	Hey plz try it .......
7174	5	a	I have finally gotten the app to work. I gotta say. I love love love this app.
7175	5	a	Wow it takes a minute to get it ..but when you do....AWESOME!!
7176	1	a	يجب القول اللهم صلي على محمد وعلى اله وصحبه وسلم
7177	5	a	To enjoy with my family and friends
7178	5	a	This is super handy. Awesome to actually understand if any colours are missing from my view - as I have a limited colour pallet. Thank you for this! 5 stars. 10 stars if I could.
7179	1	a	After successfully moving the apps, my sd became corrupt, now have to delete the sd card
7180	5	a	I love it. Its quick and fun!!!good for ur brain!
7181	1	a	Everytime I try to open it, it takes me back to home screen please fix
7182	4	a	REALLY SLOW BUT..... Liked it. MAN I don't know why peeps are saying u can't do tricks!? Bye for now anyway!:-(
7183	4	a	FNAF3Demo is a great way test your skills before the real thing. In this FNAF you don't really get scared because you don't see many animatronics. The only animatronics that I got jumpscared by was Chicago and Spring trap. Please put more! Even though its a demo doesn't mean it shouldn't have less quality that the real thing. See my other ratings and I will finish this rating soon.
7184	5	a	Its really realistic.  Also challenging a bit, but thats what makes it fun. I mean would you rather have it a little challenging, or really easy? Its great game.
7185	5	a	Very good app its helping me lot. Please modify the software to avoid the scrolling from the beginning to selected area when I am changing from Tamil to English and vise versa.
7186	1	a	"App worked fine until they \updated\"" it on 11/10/18. Now cant even log in. Everyone reading this needs to email the app developer and tell them they stink at the one job they were given to do. Deleting app and reinstalling DOES NOT solve the problem AGAIN...EMAIL THE APP DEVELOPER IF YOUR APP ISNT WORKING."""
7187	1	a	Stuck on level 199 contacted support never contacted me back
7188	2	a	Used to work great. Now it fails every time I try to add an image or changes the orientation. Uninstaller.

7191	1	a	Bloody wastage of time. Plz don't download thia app.
7192	3	a	Even when it is not running there are app stop errors that pop up.  Why is it running when I don't have it selected as a wallpaper?
7193	1	a	" hence the 1 star."""
7194	1	a	The gun won't stay still and the deer and the elephant won't die
7195	5	a	very nice game i would like more ^3^ I've got a pearl white lenovo tab 2 a10 so its full hd beautiful and 10.1 inches for download issues i recommend fast wifi and es file explorer to check files for duplicate copies
7196	5	a	Hurt me Hurt Me HURT ME...what a fantastically irritating piece of shimmering success. Get this app...I dare you...but get the wife and kids out before you start playing. It's maddening... 'WHERE'D YANKEES PUT THE LIQUID DRAINO' maddening...but you will love it. I chuckled at first, then I started tensing up, my pupils dilated and my breathing slowed and then I found myself talking (quite loudly) to the thing. Best BLAST for a buck.
7197	5	a	So far an excellent game
7198	3	a	The mobile site is working when I go to it on my phone. Don't know why it isn't working on the app now...it works perfectly on other apps. I liked this one to....Oh well
7199	5	a	This is the best Sudoku app out there. The controls allow for quick filling,  there are multiple themes, and the help and reference system is thorough.  Plus, the developer responds quickly to issues.
7200	4	a	Wow this is cool man,! :-)
7201	3	a	I have only one problem with it... well when i exit a mission and go back 2 the village then the screen stays locked in one place.its a miracle that i can even find my way when is happens.wait and u need 2 add more weapons and a new skill for the blunt weapons section in the gear shop
7202	5	a	DOWNLOAD THIS GAME FOR HOURS OF FUN         This game has a large variety of differnt activities for anyone to take place in to further themselves in the game. This is good as sometimes some aspects may get boring but you can later switch to new activities inside the game. Some of these activities gan be gaining the dollar by many varying methods such as: mining, fishing, wood cutting, cutting plants/bushes, doing crops inaide your house, bugs, bounties, firemaking and more. If the player gets tired of making money you can then set of to the trade jouse and trade your hard earned dollar for some cool items. There are lots of differnt items in this game from lots of differnt holiday events and the hardworking admins keep updating the items in the game. Another activity that people can do is basing, a very fun way to join up with a gang hold a base and shoot lots of people to gain gang hours and gang points, both of these rewards very helpful. Finally you can make many many friends from all around the world, you can meet people and become best friends with them and do various activities with them to add more fun to the game itself. Overall i do rate this game a 5 out of 5 as it ticks all my boxes, will it tick your boxes? I think it will.
7203	5	a	This game is a great curling experience. If you remotely like curling this game is for you. It doesn't have as many features as the full version but it is still an awesome game. It takes a while to get used to playing, as any game would. This is the curling game of the century. Anyone who rates this less than perfect is clearly not a curling fan. Amazing game!!!
7204	5	a	I love this app! I've used it for the past 4 black Fridays!
7205	1	a	Every single selection u have to  go  through ads cannot comment without rating,,,,, or would have given 0
7206	3	a	is there any spesification requirement ? its so laggy on my lenovo s5000 tablet. is it bug or my device ? good games anyway ..
7207	3	a	I don't realy like the game it's just nail  polish
7208	3	a	I need delete option to remove images from the smartwatch
7209	3	a	But I hate that too many ads...
7210	4	a	So cool that my wall paper moves
7211	4	a	I like the game it's very easy to play.
7212	2	a	Not sure what's going on, but this app is nothing but a bother.  Here we go again, cut out again as I was typing this. (Dropped another star.) I've used this program  in the past with no problems. But now! Not sure whats happened, but I regret having purchased any books. It's not my phone (Samsung Galaxy 6 for Sprint)  This is the only app giving me trouble. Audible is kicking it's butt, often times in cost, and definitely in performance.  Annoying at best. Really wish to remove DRM and transfer purchases.
7213	3	a	I'm now using Galaxy note 8 and set this app with a higher priority so it will not be turned off by the system optimization. However, the app will only work for some time until it becomes unresponsive. Any tips on how to make this work on Samsung Galaxy Note 8? I bought this app because i think it's useful.
7214	5	a	I like this because have all information i need in time
7215	5	a	it is good but it should have more spells
7216	2	a	I didn't like it because when I went into pizzaria mode, I was in the office and I tried to go into different rooms but it was too dark and I couldn't see any thing. I am disappointed now, it seemed like a really fun game but it is really impossible to go anywhere because it is too dark. Sorry I couldn't give it a higher rate. Other than that, the creative and survival mode was fun, just kinda hard to controll the person. Please fix these things.
7217	2	a	Looks great, but notifies software update then shuts down audio consistently. Annoying as I paid for full upgrade. Hope they fix soon.
7218	2	a	the changes and updates suck. they dont show the payouts anymore
7219	5	a	Electr games at times not you know the more lies
7220	4	a	I love how smartphones are currently powerful enough to have these re-releases of old PC classics. Darkstone was released in a time of Diablo clones, and I remember really enjoying the demo version of it as a kid.  It's good to see that this Android port has been well adapted to touchscreen controls. The game is very fun to play on a phone.  I was worried at first because of the IAP's (I prefer to just pay for the app), but fortunately they are just optional purchases of money or items to support the developer. As far as I can tell the base game without IAP's is the same as the original.
7221	5	a	This a great sudoku game, for beginners and experts alike. It has excellent teaching modes and explains all the technical aspects of sudoku- for those people who want to know more.
7222	5	a	Awesome in every respect. I find myself just staring at it at night sometimes. Just switched to Nova Launcher and am having trouble getting it to stay on-- but I'll still just start it up and just watch it for a while anyway. It's that awesome.
7223	1	a	You got to subscribe to get the benefit!!
7224	1	a	Ar mushaobs. Chicago DROID x
7225	4	a	A good and solid simple flight simulator which allows you to experience the essence of flying. I've had some hair-raising moments with it. Great fun! I only wish it were available for Samsung Galaxy Nexus as well. Thank you for sharing it!
7226	1	a	Since the app was updated the available dining options are never accurate. This was the only thing that I used the app for and it doesn't work anymore.
7227	3	a	I love Evangelion, it is one of my favorite anime shows. However, this set as my live wallpaper really bogged down my LG G4. Not sure if it is the app or the phone, but I can't have it as my live wallpaper anymore. If it didn't slow my phone down, then I would give this 5 stars.
7228	4	a	No need for this anymore
7229	1	a	Garbage app. Download this app if your gay
7230	4	a	you have to install and run Adobe Air before this starts working, but once you do, it works fine. Only real problem is the resolution of the picture is the resolution of your screen so when it saves, it's the size of a screenshot
7231	5	a	Not tried it yet but reviews I read makes me believe its a great app. Wow!
7232	5	a	I love this app. It is a great application to edit all sorts of photos, especially when the camera on your phone is not the best! I also have fun making collages too and there are a variety of filters that help make your photo more interesting. A great app and I definitely recommend it to all. Its simple to use, yet still amazing!
7233	3	a	What I thought it would let you add people on Sims freepaly not fair tell us how

7235	1	a	Maps are not detailed enough. Where is Florence? You seem to have forgotten it. Less than useless.
7236	2	a	cannot connect in any way! :/
7237	5	a	More than a proof of concept!
7238	5	a	الله يرزاك خير الي صمم البرنامج بطل ولله🙏👍👏👐
7239	5	a	My kids love this app
7240	1	a	1 star or even less. Annoying ads before, after and instead of each activity. Uninstalling.
7241	1	a	I can't open my statement
7242	4	a	This game is a hard game of foosball against countrys
7243	5	a	I  love boxing !
7244	5	a	Ok super love d pink
7245	5	a	Can you guys please add Nova launcher prime free only for one day please please please.
7246	5	a	Actually this game came before subway surfers for your information and this game is better than stupid surfers! Everyone is saying it's like stupid surfers!  SCROLL DOWN THE COMMENTS AND YOU WILL SEE! THIS GAME CAME FIRST! I hope I made myself clear for all you dumb losers!
7247	5	a	This is the best app I have ever seen. Thank you very much. Hare krishna.
7248	3	a	You cant save and exit. And slender doesnt attack you if you dont look back and it tajes too much time to find 8 notes. I found 6 of them in like 20 min its ez but too long
7249	5	a	Love it, customer service  is excellent!
7250	1	a	I can't play it every time I try it turns my tablet off and I have to turn it back on.
7251	1	a	All you do is look at ordinary houses. Trust me not a game ,so horrible I deleted it in 5 minutes. Don't get the game
7252	5	a	For those giving 1 star and complaining, do you even read before downloading? It clearly states on GO SMS Pro some fonts are free, others you have to pay for if your not pro. Don't think it deserves a bad rating because you can't read.     But the font is beautiful and is a great addition to the theme I have. No issues downloading or applying it at all. Definitely keeping it on.
7253	1	a	Worst in another all for freeee
7254	5	a	I am really enjoying this app! It is so nicely done and very easy on the eyes. Would love to see a Morning \u0026 Evening app from you in the same color scheme and format.
7255	1	a	This app is so pointless and time wasting. It wouldn't let me save my \npicture or take a selfie. If you want to warp a picture I suggest using a \ndifferent app.
7256	5	a	Pls make a new update like new runes but overall i love it so much
7257	5	a	Worked to wake up hubby
7258	1	a	I used this app before and everything everything worked fine. Now with my new GS3, it says it's installed but does not show on my app list. It's a fine tool but I do miss it on THIS phone.
7259	5	a	Best archery game ever but you realy should upgrade the armor
7260	1	a	This game is dume and I hate it for life. I'm
7261	3	a	it is very laggy indeed and that it is very boring because you only do makeup on four ppl. I dislikr the game because there is not much to do. However the graphics are great. That is why I have gave tou three stars.
7262	1	a	Never works! I am getting something else
7263	5	a	Works with different devices I've tested... eg. Transformer Tf700, HTC Flyer or HTC one x..  No problem connecting, freezing or similar
7264	3	a	I insanely loved this game but im giving it 3 stars because im having problems with the controls. I think this is a great game but it would be more comfortable with a D-pad moving control and buttons for attacking please kindly throw a future update of the game and add a control setting to enable swiping attacks and typing movement or to enable buttons and D-pad. Please kindly check my review and sorry for my grammar.
7265	2	a	Why didnt record rhe call ? Its just a lil prank.
7266	5	a	Awesome game for fun and memory training!!!
7267	4	a	Bla bal bal thank you
7268	5	a	I try a lot of themes but i only like that theme
7269	1	a	Worst app in the world
7270	4	a	This game is fun. You buy animals in your zoo and have customers come by. You can raise or lower the prices of tickets. Just try to keep the customers happy, so no over charging them and buy animals, plants and buildings.  Problem is it needs more decorations, more area to buy, more quests...more everything. It becomes so repetitive so fast with little changes.
7271	2	a	The app needs a lot of improvement it doesn't allow you to stay in itself it's more a Scion of a browser window. This act causes many problems, pictures of exceedingly long load times the app crashes constantly and often times simply sends you to a version of Google Chrome or whatever browser I imagine you might have on a phone that isn't an Android. It really does require Improvement it logs you out of your account every time it shuts down of its own accord and browsing is not easier within the app than it is on the website through your phone.
7272	5	a	Nice game I love it keep the good work up it gets 5 stars
7273	4	a	I think it will solve my problems but Can you check the मराठी aksharantaran does not suggest words. Which makes it impossible to use.
7274	5	a	I love it some much
7275	5	a	where karin kuruma spawn for free
7276	5	a	Need a little more time.
7277	3	a	A quite messy app. However it does the promised, uploads onto dailymile. Not veryneat tho
7278	3	a	The Graphics quality has changed. Not at all good. Don't feel like playing.
7279	5	a	What a hell! Oh my god. Who can beat this.... a must have professional application for techies.... Hats off to developers..... now its working in lollypop too...
7280	1	a	Have to pay for chips to evan play that's lame and you pay rediculas amounts of money for them I strongly insist you don't get this game
7281	5	a	I love it because it shows fun
7282	5	a	Its a great glitches game more fun when glitches
7283	1	a	It says nothing that i could find about getjar gold until you try to apply it
7284	5	a	Really love that you can customize in detail! It does take a sec to load, but my phone is older (and bogged down with junk/photos) so this may not be the normal case. Loved this app so much that I bought the upgrade. Totally worth a buck fifty.
7285	5	a	Excellent! So hard to find apps in European Portuguese!
7286	4	a	Please insert some widgets !!!
7287	2	a	This game could be better. It starts the same way every time. All the vowels are usually on one side. It starts you over there's no picking up where you stopped.
7288	5	a	I haven't used this type of visits before but I hope I get it figured out \nso I can visit my friend Donald
7289	5	a	Its really a adventurous game!Please every one download it . you all will enjoy this game.
7290	3	a	Please fix it... hurry up
7291	5	a	This app is looking good but I don't know how it is from inside
7292	5	a	This app works great. I had been looking for a way to have a different pic on each of my screens (5) and this was the answer. Experia play phone.  I have just got a new phone a droid DNA and it seems I am having the same problem as alot of people are.  The app loads and but the picture does not change when you go to another screen. And the apply button is greyed out in the settings screen. Please help. Love this app.
7293	2	a	It was easy to use ...i created albums and downloaded photos from my gallery...thinking that they are all downloaded...i deleted the photos from the gallery thinking they are in my newly created albums...now I can't see any photos in the albums...am i not suppose to delete photos from my gallery ???
7294	5	a	Bardzo przemyślana i dokładnie zrobiona aplikacja! Polecam! 😎
7295	5	a	Exactly the way i want from a gps apps.....i am using asus fonepad
7296	3	a	Doesn't have all the chapters; not anywhere near as good as a similar app by Radif Sharafullin for apple devices.
7297	1	a	I thought you got to design and make the house yourself so I just what to play basically and hated it do not buy this app it will CRUSH YOUR SOUL so do not duy it is am waning you so don't say I didn't
7298	5	a	All weep xml all appeal
7299	5	a	best logo game so far
7300	1	a	"What a wast of Data.\/these frames are not whats being download other frames pop up..."""
7301	5	a	Such a fun game, it has cute little details and graphics too! :)😺
7302	2	a	Very poorly done, coming as a developer.
7303	4	a	It's great, I love it and didn't expect to. But the ads take up the screen at the bottom and I can't scroll so half the time if I'm travelling I can't press leave, and I get stuck in a cave or something. I would be willing to purchase the game and buy out the ads but I don't see that option
7304	4	a	Really like the nightmare series. Can't wait for more!
7305	1	a	Stupid...doesnt even work right.  LL used to be a fun, time-waster R rated game for DOS PC (pre Windows)...how that classic morphed into this complete piece of shyte, I have no clue.  Don't waste your time.
7306	1	a	The game is nice but have not understood that how can a ship fly . My ship sometimes flies off in the air . Secondly I am not able to earn money even after delivery of the cargo . Pls fix all this and add more camera options too . Hope to see a better update
7307	4	a	Pleas make a play button
7308	1	a	Cannot plug in my own functions, makes this a useless app.
7309	3	a	"Swift follow up. Still a bit glitchy when trying to tweet with pic. It goes immediately to \failed tweet\""."""
7310	3	a	It was okay but there's too many ads and it won't work now it's just froze on the home paige I've even tried re - installing and it still didn't work😤
7311	3	a	Works well but every single hand in which cards are passed, I receive the King or Ace of clubs - without exception. There are random play flaws.
7312	5	a	Best torch ever! I have had this torch since I had my first Mobile phone and I've never look back. Best of the Best to have.
7313	3	a	Weren't there clans in the picture???Why no clan???
7314	1	a	Doar trustul intact e disponibil.
7315	5	a	Incredible game however it would be good to add some sort of custom units \nand building and maps. In addition multi hight maps would be good and \npossibly battles in space as the controles and quality of the game are far \nto good to be abandoned
7316	5	a	Perfect app..... Couldn't be better
7317	4	a	Could be smoother to zoom and move about
7318	5	a	Yes this truly gets five stars and if I could give out more stars I most certainly will.\tKeep doing what u are doing cause u are doing exactly what the people want..
7319	1	a	Will not validate on 3 different phones.
7320	5	a	i think its really cool
7321	3	a	Virus removel may be installed
7322	1	a	Game was fun until level 10 when the ads came. There's no way to close them. It's not a wonder why this game is lowly rated. Un installed.. Re-rated to 1 star.. Left for a few months and came back.. Nothings changed great job on killing a good game devs!
7323	5	a	شكرا جزيلا على هذا التطبيق مفيد كتير وحلو  بارك الله فيكم في ميزان حسناتكم ان شاء الله
7324	5	a	The music with this app is amazing. I already downloaded all the other versions as well. I really enjoy the challenge behind learning and playing each soundpack. Continue to improve and I look forward to what the future holds for this app.
7325	3	a	It kept double jumping in certain spots when I wasn't even touching for it to do so.
7326	4	a	For those who want to use the pictures as wallpaper, just set an account on onedrive which is free and send the picture there, then from your onedrive or cloud which is the same, bring your picture and set it as wallpaper, easy...
7327	1	a	Deleted I refuse to give a company that much control over my phone to play a game! Ridiculous and not needed.. Wouldn't let me open casino because I refused to allow the to make, manage my ph calls and refused to allow them to photo or video.. Bloody pathetic have plenty over games that don't require what you want
7328	5	a	First off, I am never one to play puzzle games, much less a paid one! But this game is brilliant I loved it! It's not too time consuming, simple and elegant and it's fun! I can't get enough. Can't wait for future updates!
7329	4	a	Awesome theme Mr York!  Used it on my SGS2 and recently upgraded to a S4. Any chance you could make an HD version of it? Would be greatly appreciated.
7330	5	a	I love this game. Always play this game when I can't be out fishing.
7331	3	a	It takes too long to sell fish! I used to love this game, but from all the very bad reviews I won't be buying if it freezes and resets game going to/during selling fish!
7332	5	a	This is a pretty good app for finding your range on the golf course but not only that, you can also find your car in a parking lot if you mark it . I like this app.
7333	5	a	This is such a great game because i'm bored all of the time. And it's so fun.
7334	1	a	Not working on lenovo 6010 pls update or remove it
7335	5	a	Great calculator. It does everything I want it to and I'm always learning new features.
7336	4	a	If I want to crop a picture it goes back on the menu. Plzzzzzz fix it.  Cause I like this app so much!😢
7337	5	a	It's simply beautiful \u0026 cheers me up !! I love IT!🎈🎈🎈🎈
7338	3	a	The physics are garbage And you can't even control your rover other than using powerups. This is stupid
7339	1	a	Is not in my Ar effect to use!!! Only to install again!😨
7340	1	a	If I could pay to turn the ads off I would. They block the view of the cards and you can't x them out! Uninstalling.
7341	2	a	I like the game alot, worth five stars. Though, there is a problem, after \nreinstalling all my progress has been lost, I was on tier 5 and my account \nwas connected with google play, still after reinstalling I'm back at tier \n1. Can you help?
7342	2	a	I thought I'd like it, the keys are a great size and I make less errors, the comma is easily accessed by the period and it's everything I want in a keyboard... but it is not a qwerty keyboard in vertical mode on my phone as the keys are enlarged, so it spells qetuo across the top instead! I have minimized it to 80%, which is the smallest it will go but the keys are still scrambled beyond recognition, making typing much slower. I wanted to like it but I just can't. Only good if you text in landscape mode.
7343	5	a	After seeing the kids play with these I decided to give it a try, just thinking it would be another silly app. Well, it made me feel silly in front of my kids. Even sillier when I try to cheat.. and draw long lines.. not for short tempered people.
7344	5	a	Your articles always give me another view of many things
7345	5	a	Alhamdulillah,  now we can listen all from harmain everything. Masha Allah.
7346	4	a	Kenapa cuma ada RRI Bone sama RRI Makassar di SulSel, kabupaten yang lain?
7347	1	a	All u do is look at stuff   :(
7348	4	a	Alright. Just change how it deducts points for other cars crashing into you.
7349	1	a	Cumbersome to press send key and then home or menu. Can't send recent app keys. No way to open notification window or quick settingers. No way to select text by touble tap and drag. No way to use epic 4g physical keyboard to send commands that are otherwise stock on the epic 4g. For example holding shift+arrow to select text. Holding menu+c/x/v to copy/cut/paste text. When the transmitter device goes landscape with the epic 4g keyboard, the trackpad area stays portrait. Very sloppy, poor design for paid app
7350	2	a	Uninstalled this but Popup ads still on my tablet now becos of ur app. Do not download theme by this developer if u dont want uninvited pop-up ads on ur device!!  U give false contact email address n i assuem u lie on fixing the emoji bug, AND damn virus-like popup ads still comes up even the app is uninstalled!!
7351	3	a	Good except there is no portion size listed.
7352	4	a	Great game need more levels and opponents
7353	5	a	How come I can't change orientation of map anymore. It only let's me zoom.   Fixed it. I haven't found more accurate plotting.  Quickly helps me find my way out of ranches.
7354	5	a	The perfect app for someone who hates drawing maps, works SO good with map pdfs.
7355	3	a	No longer works on marshmallow just shows grey screen
7356	1	a	It would've been nice to see this app, I love pandas but it kept force closing n making my phone freeze. Uninstall asap!!! Samsung Gem.
7357	5	a	I want the older version. It at least had multiple undoings through the hardware back button.
7358	5	a	I have used this app for 2 Christmas holidays and winter seasons now. I havent found an app I like better yet. Try it you'll like it!
7359	5	a	It is great even with the galaxy7 and how it uses the censor to detect the \nheart rate of the user BUT I'm having trouble with pairing it with the \nlifelog app (how i found this) so I need some help thanks for making a good \nand useful app🖒🖒☺
7360	5	a	Great app to find all you need to know about your Wi-Fi network.
7361	4	a	I just accept more accurate ..

7364	5	a	Searched high and low.. after a long time searching for the best sandbox type kids launcher, this has proven to be all that and more.    Very kid and parent friendly.   Thanks devs!  (This is a genuine review not a  fluff post..  I rarely bother with a full review.)
7365	5	a	Pavs. Best 10 search of all! Thxs ya'll!!💟
7366	5	a	Works better than it looks. Don't forget to include the other ones.keep up the good work.please make different ones tooB-)
7367	3	a	If I'm killing something kinda big like a deer or a wolf the game just shuts down and goes to my home screen. It happens every once in a while but its annoying. Great game though!!
7368	2	a	Why are you attacking me.  Right after I bought it it got funky.

7377	5	a	I love all the themes and I love my zenfone. I have 3 of it actually. A 2,5 and 6. You guys are awesome. A PC gamer's dream phone, by my preferences, is to have an mobile phone running on intel cpu and you guys did it. How about some anime themes like SAO or FMA Brotherhood :)
7378	5	a	Perfect. The people moaning it dosen't work need to learn about SuperSu. Stop winging wake the f**k up ;) it's great lol.
7379	1	a	Okay I hate to say this, but there is literally no reason in the world to download this app. It might quite possibly be the worst dub sampler app.
7380	1	a	"Tried to use this to reduce the volume below the android lowest level. App didn't change the volume at all, has a ton of ads, and still requires use of the \options\"" button which Google has been getting rid of. Worthless app."""
7381	3	a	I would love for this app to notify me when they're are trucks within a certain distance of my current location. Or to be able to set 'hot spots' and get a notification when anything is nearby to either my house or work. I haven't had any issues with the reliability of the information, I just wish it did more.
7382	4	a	How about more options when it comes to the default photos you offer for the covers? Also more functions when it comes to handling the letters because some writers like to mess around with fonts and orientation of the letters! But this is great so far it was very helpful with a few covers of mine!
7383	1	a	This app is so bad
7384	1	a	Hard to use the app when you can't see anything in the boxes to select! Love the idea and looks like a great app. Please fix it so I can change my rating and enjoy this app!

7396	1	a	Not working on my note 3 with lollipop 5. Very very pathetic. Please update the app to work with lollipop.
7397	5	a	Seems to actually test the functionality of antivirus programs.
7398	2	a	The app is a great idea, but the English is so poor that I don't know what the games are about half of the time
7399	5	a	I can prank my friends with this app
7400	3	a	Mbm is like my favorite puzzle game of all time, so you can imagine my excitement of finding this game. It's a bit slow and once it gets even a little fast, it stops responding well. I dont like that these objects feel they need to move, because I think it makes it slower. Lots of potential.  Im gonna keep it in hopes they update it and make it awesome! I will re-rate if they do
7401	5	a	It's amazing game and good graphic s
7402	4	a	Great app to pass time. Only 1 or 2 ads. 10 levels all free. Just enough puzzles in each level. Some harder than others, but fun. Just with there was a mid progress save with the tougher clues and all.. But does save once each board is completed.
7403	2	a	Animation does not work on a note 2 and there is a giant black strip down the right.
7404	1	a	When I open the app it shows a tiny blue square- the working area for the picture. I upload an image and it only shows half of it inside the tiny blue square. No way to zoom or enlarge the working area. This is an unusable app on the Galaxy S6.
7405	1	a	Uninstalled and reinstalled same problem. Sent reports and no updates after months uninstalling for good.
7406	5	a	great work, beautifully done, but not really free. I haven't messed around with getjar and the points so I just paid the $2. To me it was worth the $2. 5 stars for the theme.
7407	2	a	I didn't give it 5 stars cuz it is boring u can't do anything on it
7408	5	a	Nothing happened at all no crashing If you don't want it  your out of your  mind so be quiet I love  it it's free free free free you suck people who don't  like it ditch it than wait dumb  people
7409	5	a	K I shook in fear when it said yes. I had a bad heart attack.

7417	2	a	Beautiful, but does not work with some screen lockers, such as Rainy Paris. It just turns on the wallpaper but no longer rings nor shows the notification. Also should allow custom ring screens such as a snapshot of my real ring screen. Otherwise excellent.

7420	5	a	I loved it and i made my first kiss while playing on it so thanks
7421	2	a	The app crashes every time I use it.  Since the device is very dependent on the device I'll be returning the spot unit.
7422	5	a	The app is perfect I am a huge fan of destiny the creators did a awesome job and I say to the creators good job😀.
7423	5	a	Been using it every night now as my bedside clock. Haven't had an issue. Great app!

7426	1	a	Won't open first door with clicking and starts over every time you exit game. I saw similar comment when purchasing so think I'm not only one. Developer please contact me to fix and I will change rating
7427	1	a	This APP is utter conn, has no button for transfer to SD card, it takes you \nto uninstall button, so be carefull . No way one can transfer APP to SD \nCard. Utter waste of time and money.
7428	1	a	I was so excited when another mom on daughters team showed me this app... Until I attempted to download on my phone!  I get a login screen with no option to register?? Can't even use it!

7437	5	a	I've don't played this game but the pics are so cute
7438	3	a	The game doesn't always register my touches causing me to lose even though I touched the tiles. In a game that relies on quick touches, the inability to register touch all the time simply makes no sense. Use the remakes instead. Much better.
7439	4	a	Good apps. But does not work after upgrading to lollipop.. Samsung Tab S.
7440	5	a	i wish this game wont fail me.
7441	1	a	It doesn't do anything except put a number of new updates at the top of the watch but doesn't load the page to see the new updates.  It, much like the Facebook app for the watch is straight junk.
7442	3	a	This new app looks promising. Way better than the glitchy web counterpart that doesn't accept my service id, total kwh and bill date. I was able to register quickly and efficiently. I'll change my comment here as I get my bills and will see if this promising new app did indeed hit the marks.
7443	4	a	This app gives you a full day of workout!!
7444	5	a	This app is lovely colours are beautiful so bright love it
7445	1	a	Bad cause it an online game .and waste of data
7446	1	a	This app didn't work . Kept closing!
7447	5	a	Finally someone got it right. Perfect for when I'm not using Cool Tool.
7448	4	a	Safa da style hega ta dasdo   and too many ads
7449	1	a	This app used to good but since it became thumbtel now's it just doesn't work, had it on my iPhone and also Android and and it won't let me actually pay to continue my service. Ive missed important messages from my son's hospital. , so angry! BROKEN.
7450	3	a	This app only works with the UE MINI BOOM I have a UE Mobile Boombox (a older version that looks almost exactly the same except for the slight difference in the grill design) and it does not support my speaker. Sad
7451	5	a	I've listened to the Las Vegas radios and they are pretty real time, maybe a 2 minute delay, but works for sure.
7452	5	a	Very cute. I named my puppy Fluffball. But how do you make friends?
7453	4	a	No Working at ics(cinatablet) and jellybean(lenovomidphone) [please fix] but great at other my 2(phone\u0026tablet) kitkat
7454	1	a	Vtiger is a CRM,  how could it not support  SSL? I am not opening up my instance on HTTP, so cannot use this app.
7455	3	a	But it randomly shows 'living in the sun has stopped working'. Please fix to get 5 stars.
7456	1	a	This app never works on my Android
7457	1	a	My username is longer than 20 characters yet your junk app only lets me input 20. I can't even log in
7458	5	a	Best team beacause every time they win
7459	2	a	it says I need to install the latest version of wp launcher when I already have the latest version of it
7460	4	a	Could you add a location to see what your troops do exactly? It says it when you buy them then it never says it again. Also, could you put their names in the unit picker somehow? These are kind of nitpicking. Still a great, fun game and works well.
7461	1	a	Your giving me bad grades
7462	5	a	The only thing I struggle with is the wake up time and bed time. It varies for me day to day but I have used this app a couple times to cut back. Now I'm using it to quit completely. It still takes a lot of self control but I know I can do it with this app
7463	1	a	There is to much lag I can't move all ingame.
7464	2	a	My phone was down for 3 days so I had to reload all my apps. I installed this app but it won't let me do anything..  It keeps telling me searching for my facebook profile.  It's been 12 hours.  And it still looking for my profile.  Do I move on to another app.  What the heck.
7465	3	a	The side bar is glitchy. Very poor app.
7466	3	a	the graphics are really good, but the controls are weird. since this is a rally game, why there is no handbrake? how do we suppose to drift?
7467	5	a	Good for kill time,easy too play
7468	5	a	I want to install this application
7469	5	a	This is a superb file manager!  Gives you full control over all of your files and folders, plays music files, etc., etc.!  It does even more than what's promised! :-)
7470	5	a	Looking forward to scanning some mailboxes and seeing what it does. The scan of the one on postal service mailer was very cool! Didn't know the app existed before
7471	5	a	This is one of the reasons I prefer my sw2 to my sw3. Concise and uncomplicated. Just revieve the tweets I want at intervals I want. Keeps battery use on my phone low. I wish they had a version for android wear.
7472	4	a	This book is very useful for children
7473	4	a	Devs even say it's a clone in the description. The only problem I have is with the controls. I've died dozens of times because I try to dig down and go left or right and fall to my death. It needs an option to display arrow keys on the screen!
7474	4	a	Great game I love the graphics
7475	4	a	usually up to date, good app for South African users of Eskom :(
7476	1	a	Ads keeps popping up...this sucks
7477	5	a	Very good \u0026 best app
7478	5	a	I like it. But can you in data add the names of each symbol or unit.
7479	5	a	It's a good game but could use a little adjustments
7480	3	a	Like what it has to offer so far alot but it removed my free app stats.
7481	2	a	Can't even merge a single duplicate, had me waiting then I tried by one and it failed.
7482	5	a	Nice must try it on
7483	1	a	Won't even let me get I the phrases only say install our games don't downlaod
7484	4	a	The app is very very useful in all the sense. It was installed on my mobile \nfor more than 3 years and was working well. But after I have changed my \nhandset, it doesn't work properly. When i try to download the data for a \nnew dictionary, it stops working. I have to uninstall it and then reinstall \nto get some work from it. Pl. Solve this problem at the earliest...

7488	1	a	forcing an update? no thank you.
7489	4	a	امیدوارم از این برنامه های کاربردی بازم برای اندروید ساخته بشه.
7490	3	a	for those who cannot remove the photos, before the developer fixes the problem, you can go to the file manager and search autochangewallpaper folder and remove the photos there.
7491	2	a	Have not heard the music yet
7492	1	a	This is the stupidest yahtzee app in Google
7493	1	a	Pond u game this game is the looser game in the world I think government will ban this and blue whale game will be ban please friend don't like  this game
7494	5	a	Best and oldest heart rate monitor app on play store since 2014
7495	5	a	"  art design and the music are awesome.  This game was done by the same developer who made Final Cut."""
7496	1	a	worst game ever played by me, couldn't find any game as bad as this, very poor doesn't even deserve 1 star, the worst game ever to be made in the history of gaming, I request other gamers to never ever install this game it would be like the biggest mistake of your life
7497	1	a	Is there a reason why blink chat gets stuck on the authentication screen? Or will NOT work!  Will this be fixed anytime soon?
7498	5	a	Good theme. I like it.
7499	5	a	" then bam! The last hit raises his HP....."""
7500	4	a	My kid sister is addicted.
7501	1	a	Stalno prijavljuje da mi ne radi internet. Internet radi nego aplikacija ne radi.
7502	5	a	I use this app everyday
7503	1	a	getjar sucks! they made this to make users get mad!
7504	5	a	I have looked at the other life rpgs this one is by far the easiest to work with and the best you guys have a good thing here (: and the pets are beautiful !
7505	5	a	I love snow but in NJ we haven't had much snow so this is the next best thing.
7506	5	a	I love this game..💖💖💖Im currently playing Masato Shi route.Come and join me friends.This is my invite code : aRnjdU
7507	2	a	Would be good but currency converter insists on connecting to developers own website regardless of currency source selected. if I select yahoo I want to go directly to yahoo not via developer
7508	5	a	Im really enjoying the apps tnx i recommend
7509	4	a	Makes things alot easier for if you wanna be lazy
7510	1	a	l app che fa piu schifo dei panini
7511	1	a	BOOOORIIING i thought it would be the best but it was boring the controls are fine the gaming was bad.IM ONLY8 BUT I HATED THIS GAME
7512	5	a	My son has enjoyed to play this activity
7513	5	a	App works great for me. My favorite channel.
7514	5	a	Does what it says. Good for feedback. I'm glad that I can bend. Need some practice on that hole 3.
7515	5	a	I like it is really fun u should try it
7516	4	a	Good app for telling you if you're sensors are working as they should and GPS ..buttons ect
7517	1	a	why i cant log in after install this? No wonder people said Major China \nbrand CCTV is liar!
7518	5	a	I made pink fireon it Cool right
7519	1	a	Nice but if in a chance we cross 7 lvls qnd by chance or by mistake we just remove the app al of our progress is hone plz fix it
7520	4	a	Hello I want you to add an Offline Local WiFi LAN Multiplayer mode. Thanks
7521	5	a	This is probably the best dice roller system I've ever used. It's come in handy many times over the months of our Star Wars game, the DM swears by it, and at least two players have commented that, most of the time, they only bust out the real dice when it's actually time to play- otherwise they generally use this for their dicing needs. Strikes me as high praise.
7522	5	a	My there old sister loves this app. Keep making apps like this.
7523	5	a	I love this game it's the best game I ever played
7524	4	a	Fun game, but entirely too many ads. Uninstalled.
7525	1	a	Every body who has smartphone can download it but if you switch off your Internet you can play it just like dat waste to Install
7526	2	a	נועזכצע וטכזי ייעזונ יו י ז
7527	1	a	it has  the wrong maps
7528	3	a	Only gave 3 stars because the icon colors are applied randomly. I had to change themes back and forth at least 5 times to get a combination I liked.
7529	1	a	Even when I'm not using it, it's still crashing. For an app that I paid for, it's ridiculous that it has that many bugs.
7530	5	a	I enjoy this meditation effective really really simple yet super nice
7531	5	a	This game is great, well worth upgrading for the extra levels. The courses are awesome \u0026 I think it's better than versions 2, 3 \u0026 4.
7532	1	a	I am giving it one star as giving zero star is not an option perhaps...completely useless app..shows erratic calculations of emi etc
7533	5	a	I've been using HulloMail since 2011 on a variety of phones. I've never had \nany issues with it whatsoever it works perfectly, as advertised. Can't \nrecommend it enough over the utter rubbish you get as standard with your \nservice provider.
7534	1	a	words are not beeing saved , urdu language is not here as said
7535	2	a	PoS app. Constant crashes on Android 8+
7536	5	a	Love this game no ads its awesome more cars add trucks more maps add cosdmimasms. 99000000000000 out of99000000000000
7537	1	a	Doesn't even let me login. The same login works perfectly fine on computer
7538	5	a	I use this app daily and it keeps getting better with every update. Keep up the good work.
7539	3	a	The app would be great if not for the ad placement. My baby can't play this without almost purchasing something every few minutes...which is sad cuz she loves the game.
7540	2	a	I have a HTC phone and it wouldn't let me download anything.
7541	1	a	All the things that I really want to do are closed and I have to pay money to get it the dress ,shoes,necles the fiting room and many other thing is this a game or a super market
7542	5	a	GOOD FOR HAVEING BABY BROTHERS!★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★
7543	3	a	It would be nice if you changed the shows in the marathons section, like add boondocks, bobs burgers, american dad, and put squidbillies back on it.
7544	2	a	doesn't keep time.   works for 10 minutes and then stops.   uninstalled it.
7545	2	a	Cons:The app doesn't work with Android 6.0.1 (Moto 4G PLUS). The app doesn't detect the device at all.... And the device doesn't detect the new external hard drives which is on Use 3.0 (My passport ultra). Doesn't support the latest software or hardware. Pros: The device is handy and useful. The development team should release a firmware which supports this...
7546	5	a	Very nice bachcho Ke liye bahut achha hai
7547	5	a	This is the best and easier way to learn the Quran. Jazakum Allah khayr for your efforts
7548	4	a	Crazy realistic physics and great graphics. But why no standard race. It's so bare bones just one more mode and it would be great
7549	5	a	Works perfectly: very useful for me!
7550	4	a	Good. But updates are irregular.
7551	1	a	Still can not recognise my contacts. Lagging.
7552	5	a	Cool game love it. Very different than other bingo games wtg great job on this.
7553	5	a	I love this play coz I feel happy..
7554	5	a	Works perfectly. If you're having problems with it starting on boot, make sure it's installed to the phone memory and not the SD card.
7555	5	a	I think it was a very interesting game easy to play so real
7556	5	a	The app works hassle free. The thing that really sucks here is the fact there is absence of material design. The privacy setup could be bolded better. If button for checking would have been circular rather than square, it would have added beauty.
7557	1	a	install 完一 run 就話唔 support, 唔 support 就咪鬼畀我 download 啦
7558	5	a	Enshallah in this season all titles will goes to ALWAHDA FORCE ALWAHDA♥♥♥
7559	5	a	I loved it very much
7560	1	a	This app is absolutely terrible.  The developers are A-HOLES FOR NOT USING THE RIGHT INFO.
7561	3	a	I love this game but I'll have to find something else to play if there isn't an update that will fix the: slow loading, ability to visit other farms, random screen freezes, ability to see EVERYTHING in my barn so I can sell at the roadside shop, etc. Please fix it cause I really do love this game!
7562	3	a	Only old names.not very long list for new names
7563	1	a	Har forsøgt reinstall uden held.. Crasher stadig hver eneste gang efter 3 sekunder.
7564	5	a	It's perfect just perfect !!
7565	5	a	Excellent. Would benefit with more players so join in! One problem is the number of people who are obviously cheating. Why anyone would cheat is quite beyond me.
7566	3	a	Works great when it actually works!
7567	1	a	Worst thing I ever seen
7568	2	a	Intermittently without warning simply stops working. Refuses to connect. Have to uninstall and reinstall to fix.
7569	5	a	I have been a shifts user since it's inception it's been the best at being able to show two shift pattern calendar's on one page. I have just bought a new phone and on app transfer of Shifts there were a couple.of very minor issues which were sorted out with excellent and prompt support from customer services. Excellent app. Thanks !
7570	1	a	First glance, great app. Loads of stations. But after listening to a station for about 15 minutes, it stops and I have to reload it. Rather annoying.
7571	1	a	It didn't work, only recorded a short period in the morning, besides it does not give a bar or graph to show you about what time snoring happened. That means you would have to sit there and listen to  entire 7 or 8 hours of recoding to hear when snoring happened or what it sounded like.
7572	5	a	Wow, amazing please don't change the UI or anything in for future as it might affect your image. The another best part is this app doesn't need any permission to download.  Please explain the objective of scores?!?
7573	1	a	useless, it show nothing useble among apps..
7574	5	a	I can't upgrade my defense minion! My elite lava spider wont upgrade. Sariel hint says that i have a free first upgrade but i clicked the upgrade button million times but it wont work. Its get stuck there. It wont go back nor it won't upgrade the minion. Please help me!
7575	3	a	It doesn't let me get to the music store \u0026I have been a virginmobile customer for years. Since I got a galaxy s5 it comes up error. Please fix, then l'll give you 5 stars
7576	3	a	1 of my favorite themes. Now can U guys do the Go Locker Version of this please. Thankies
7577	1	a	Boring and non sence game
7578	5	a	Helps my baby sleep, everytime and anytime! \u0026lt;3
7579	2	a	It's called a remote control but doesn't come up when launched. You have to press voice and then select the remote. If your using this as a remote what good is it if you can't do anything for the TV like in off volume ect...Can't set up recording either so I'm not sure what purpose it serves. Not worth taking up phone space.
7580	1	a	Why do it need update twice in month?
7581	2	a	Ads are super annoying. Use less annoying ads for higher score.
7582	4	a	This is one of the best apps. That I have seen in along time. I am a clock lover.!! And when I seen this one in gold. I had to have it. But four stars because I have to pay $. For the weather and date. :(
7583	5	a	Awesome,  use it daily!
7584	2	a	I hate this app. There are no traditional what you call sabeki durga idol only theme idols . Also, we can't boron ma like it is done on dashami and all. We can't offer lotuses by our hand. We can't boron MA's children and wear ma and her children garlands of flowers. We can't even give pushpanjali to the goddess or worship her as she is worshipped during Durga Puja. Please see to this facilities to make it a better app. Also instead of the song there can be the sound of dhak and kashor ghonta. The songs can be Bengali when we worship durga during pujo and their should also be an option that we want to worship ma as done in durga puja or regularly and their should also be different materials for the different cases and there should also be a. Navratri worship facility. In the durga puja theme their should be all materials needed for the pujo and we should also be able to worship her as done in pujo. Same should be in the case of other themes.
7585	1	a	Every time in about to do another wax it freezes because the adds keep popping up
7586	5	a	I love it \u003c3 worth every penny. I might add a deeper review someday when I'm not busy with holidays and life lol but if you think this is appealing at all (I mean, you're reading reviews about it lol so...) If you don't want to spend money, do google surveys but you NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE!!!
7587	2	a	I loved this app!! Why did the developer disappear?! 😠Now it no longer works so I have to give it up.
7588	1	a	No funciona lo voy a decinstalar porquería
7589	1	a	Its horrible they won't even show you how to play
7590	4	a	یه گوشی تازه واست میسازه
7591	1	a	Was a great app till it stopped working.. said there is a server error.....hope they fix quick or I will find another one that does work.will uninstall since it stopped fully...
7592	4	a	It's a great game, the only thing I would change is you should have the pug start out slow then go faster the farther you get in the game.
7593	3	a	it is to hard to play and it makes no sense ti olay ut yhee n uir ekie wiheyeoww wosojwyydbdneiidyw dieowmsmjdomduebd ieur jduebe kdehrierjde ijrrkjrjfjfjfkfkf fnfnrmrnr r d d d d d dd r rddfjirmdidrmd ifirrfiekrjkrr. kfkerjrmfkrj. iivg. gjgobjtjjfnnnmfmfmfmfmfmfmfmfmmfmfmfmgfh imploringly gadget hobo free to free up CE CE no problem crew few no no few no free no fee no fee no problem no no few no few no problem up e no no no few no few no fee up CE Jo few no few no few no no no no MP and no no
7594	5	a	Fun.  To pass the time just as good as if i was at a casino games but online.
7595	1	a	I would give it a five stars but those are the only cars you have I hope  you fix it and it also has a little bit of gas each game.
7596	5	a	Looks a bit silly, until you play the game. Can see that it will work well with our toddler
7597	4	a	I've been using this app since forever, and it's still one of my favorites. But what I want to do is choose only one picture for all my screens, whilst retaining the ability to change that picture with a double tap. Just a minor nitpick, but it's driving me nuts.
7598	1	a	I can't create a meme at all! I can only use the templates but I wanna create my own, definently uninstalling.
7599	4	a	Icons could be made much nicer than this. The colour of the icons could be brighter than the background
7600	4	a	Great thinking game! But really needs explanations.
7601	4	a	When ever I play games with my brother it makes great progress
7602	2	a	This is a fun game but the delay when I tap the screen is like a full second off... please fix
7603	5	a	Well it started of well but I'm kinda finding it hard to unlock the first code!
7604	4	a	Works great om my Moto-G, but am unable to use it on my wife's Acer Liquid Z3.  When attempting to use, it IMMEDIATELY says unrecognized command before she even has a chance to speak.  Unfortunate as I love this program
7605	3	a	لايوجد مراجع .... قصة ابراهيم عليه السلام غير كامله
7606	3	a	Loved app Until playlist \u0026 request songs options disappeared. Also no pictures anymore of artists playing.
7607	5	a	Óra és dátum egyben, szép kidolgozással, egyetlen bajom az volt vele, hogy nem tudtam átméretezni...
7608	5	a	Very good great pictures good for everyone
7609	5	a	I've played thousands of games on this app and Iike that it is straightforward without a lot of gimmicks and distractions like so many others. The fact that this one is a tutorial is fantastic and my game is eons better than before I started using this one many years ago. I tell everyone who plays or wants to play to get Enjoy Sudoku because you can start as a complete novice or find games that will challenge the most seasoned players. Enjoy!
7610	1	a	Hate it! How the hell do you scroll in this app? Everything is slow and choppy. And I'm using a HTC One M8, one of the best phones around. A useless app!
7611	4	a	I like the absence of any distractions of having to watch for time to punch some obscure prize button. That interrupts game flow and is annoyingly to me.
7612	5	a	It's rare to come across a horoscope app that actually knows what it's talking about. This one is pretty accurate. Kudos to the writers- they know their stuff. And when you get done reading the basic, daily paragraph there's a whole lot more to check out.  Complete with daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and also compatibility, plus way more for each section, it'll be hard to compete with this app. Really good stuff. Actually has already helped me to clear my head and see my path more clearly. Very pleased!!
7613	5	a	That is very nice game And its helped me in real life good driving when i \nhave learned motor class
7614	5	a	I named the triceratops chomp
7615	4	a	Once I worked out what all three buttons did I found I loved this program. Simple and effective
7616	2	a	Very addictive, irritatingly asking for rating even though already done, 4 becomes 2
7617	1	a	Soo dead like michael jackson
7618	1	a	Dumb,,, u should have the actual map of park
7619	5	a	Really fun concept with good graphics. It is something new! Recommended!
7620	5	a	Gdm hope this site is gd
7621	5	a	I like how it has been set up that is why I have rate it 5 stars it is a good game l like it by Sarah.
7622	5	a	I really like it. When I was young  I always play this with some of my friends. Now I am not alone within it.
7623	5	a	i was able to hear a loved on who passed i know it was him nobody had a voice like his it was only one word but thats all i needed to hear to help me through my day so is this app the real thing i say 100% yes thank you ghost studio
7624	1	a	Essentially useless, no support for anything beyond 4.2? Poor form,  MS.
7625	5	a	I find Puzzli fascinating. It’s a beautiful and colorful collection of pictures from every single topic I could imagine. I like the concept of making it like tiles and not the old jigsaw style. I think that makes it particularly relaxing and ease to solve for me.
7626	5	a	Thank you for this! Whoever you are
7627	3	a	A lot of talking but good for singers out there
7628	1	a	Not to helpful if you can't use the insurance. They never sent me a physical card and I can't get my information through the app.  Is this a new strategy to keep claims down?  Had to pay for the doctor visit without insurance.
7629	1	a	I don't really like the game because , the spino is running
7630	1	a	It's winter let me dolond
7631	1	a	Well I think this game is another Unity poop again. The same tree from another game. Also, dafuq there's a giant insects in the game?!
7632	1	a	I think this game sucks.It barely was fun and it has to much adds
7633	4	a	It needs more levels, how am I suppose to share this with only 35 levels
7634	2	a	مفيهاش خدمات أنترنت. برامج اللبيانه الأخرا أفضل.
7635	5	a	The game has no gorgeous game graphics and complex operation,but, it is very fun.When I play the game, I feel happy,so,this is one of the best small game I played.
7636	5	a	So much time is saved using this app. Let alone table space
7637	1	a	This app is not up to date, Ekiti election results are not there and I expect a live update from the Osun election collation center... If you improve on that I promise you a better rating.
7638	4	a	Doesnt seem to translate as you type, and had error with spanish to english punctuation, but still did the right translation. Definately recommend!
7639	5	a	App works great, is quick to use. Had no issues with cards being recognized, but be wary of dim lighting or bright glare on cards, as the camera won't be able to read them.
7640	4	a	enjoying this apps, but i must be throttle to control the sound
7641	5	a	Good but need to develop cities all over india
7642	1	a	Still the same non functional app. Don't download. Very disappointed I love \nthe radio:(
7643	5	a	Got it for my grandson very good
7644	4	a	You can do make day night mode head light button and a nice thing like we want to go to The birthday or marriage party so first make we comming out of our home parking and then make story mode we came near the parking of party and after when we parked then they go in the party and when they coke out same go out of the parking and park in the homes parking. Please do like this then all will download it please do. Thanks
7645	5	a	Nice Game! Good Job Dev
7646	5	a	I find it very useful.
7647	3	a	I love magic tricks so much but all you do is watch magic trick and spend your coins for magic tricks I thought this was gonna be fun sorry uninstalling
7648	5	a	I work as a pipe fitter in semiconductor industry, this app makes life easier every day can't recommend it enough
7649	1	a	I cant play the game without instructions and telling me to tap a light switch and press play only makes me have to restart the level. Boring, not worth my time
7650	5	a	I've been looking for another tower defense game to replace my absolute favorite, The Creeps. But even though I've played through every level pack on 3 devices, I kept coming back because no other game was as good. This game has finally changed that. It's not exactly the same, but it's lots of fun, \u0026 it may even be better. If you like this game, try Monkeys \u0026 Bloons.
7651	4	a	This works great, I've used it ever since I started my new job. Only downside is when I have just one 5 week month due to Christmas/new year! Just messes everything up when I change it to 5 weeks, because they're not all 5 weeks! Would be great if we could move shifts to and from pay periods.
7652	5	a	So I had this app one my old phone to I loved it but I don't really use it for meme I use it for wen I kinda like to wright cuz if I want to right on memo  and post it people will think something didn't but if I do it like on the memes people think I got it one the Google images so they won't know what I'm thinking
7653	5	a	A must to download, it really works
7654	3	a	The algorithm you want is loop through the numbers 0-51. And on each loop generate a random number from 0-51, swap the card at randomly generated index with the card at the index of the number from the loop. This is mathematically proven to be unbiased if you can generate a truly random number
7655	5	a	I really hate this don't get I/ T all
7656	5	a	This is a great App used for finding and showing guitar chord tabs for videos or songs through youtube. I personally love it as i forget some chord positions but this App is great for that. Very good App 10/10
7657	2	a	You don't get play most of the time every slot wants money for coins!!!
7658	1	a	Crashes after a few seconds of video playing
7659	1	a	Can't see the whole picture. How are you supposed to gauge the power and distance needed when you can't get the whole field on the screen? You're aiming at something you can't even see! This game isn't for a phone.This is a dud. Big time.Uninstalled
7660	4	a	I have a few things to say about this app: First of all, I think it's wonderful! I am obsessed with all things space. The ads are annoying, but at least they feature some cool products like telescopes, microscopes, etc. At least it's not those annoying TikTok advertisements and game ads. That's a plus for me! I think it would be cool if they would include actual pictures of the surfaces of the planets we've been able to take photographs of-(continue to next passage)
7661	5	a	It's an amazing way of keeping reports!!
7662	1	a	Not working after some stages
7663	2	a	The number of times I have to tap to select a tile is incredibly irritating! Other than that it's a good app. But I dont play it often because of the selection trouble.
7664	4	a	The anticipation of the different traps make your heart beat faster especially as the game becomes more intense. Great for a boredom buster 😁😁😁
7665	1	a	The pictures were very blurry, and when you selected them you could not see which one it was until you went to set it as your wall paper. Super disappointed.
7666	2	a	But the apps is not good, especially the flip book mode, the resolution is very low and difficult to read the text...
7667	3	a	This is an awsome Idea, and you have laid the groundwork for a potentially great game. But it's lacking some features. I would make it beatable by taking over every city. All the boats floating around should be linked to cities. Each city should have 1-5 depending on the city size. You can capture a city directly and attract all its boats, or hit each boat before taking the city. Taking the city before the boats expands your fleet as a reward, but is much harder to do. Also make the main ship upgradable.
7668	1	a	Although I love the game. I purchased gems went to bed with 68 woke up with 4? Been over a week and still no resolution. Customer service is lousy. WILL BE UNINSTALLING!!! Been playing well over year. THEY MUST DO BETTER!!!! Unsatisfied customer and NO REFUND RECEIVED FOR MISSING GEMS AND RECEIPT SUPPLIED!!! 😠😤
7669	5	a	A little roundabout, but it does what it claims, and fills a badly needed niche. Used with GMail.
7670	3	a	Server can't open keep on restarting
7671	3	a	I belive that its a really bad idea to stop recording by shake.   You could be walking,  running g,  getting beat,  or someone trying to get your phone and cause the recording to stop.   Real bad idea.
7672	3	a	The bird sounds are nice, and many of the tracks are bird sounds with music. Unfortunately, I get an SD card error when I try to use apply the sounds as a ringtone, and the app keeps pulling up huge obnoxious ads that are difficulty to escape and make it difficult to navigate back to the playlist of sounds. I'll probably delete it.
7673	5	a	I've been using this app for a long time now and still love using it on both my phone and tablet. Can't say I've ever experienced any issues with it. It has a great back up feature which is essential for flasherholics :-)
7674	1	a	Sold 3 books mailed them in like i was told and never got paid
7675	5	a	This game is awesome and I love it!! But I have a Samsung galaxy note3 and it hasn't updated yet, my friend has a iPhone 4 and his has been updated for awhile but mine hasn't, it's getting boring with the same levels and would like it if it updated on Samsung galaxy note3.
7676	4	a	I don't like the adds....they could st least have something to with the app or other beneficial (health related) apps
7677	4	a	It's good. It is good prep, just dislike how you can't see a passage or whatever while trying to see all the options as well..
7678	1	a	Crashed note5 both times I installed it
7679	1	a	It's good to watch 30 minutes videos or under like  but for movies or  Over 45 minutes the app don't connect to chromecast.
7680	4	a	very great and useful app
7681	3	a	I can't log in, it loads a part of the bar then stops and it won't load more. If I could log back in I would rate it 5 stars! Is there a way I could install it then reinstall and get my original data back?
7682	5	a	Superb.It's clean,robust and powerful.Sudoku is fun yet challenging.
7683	3	a	It take so much time it's irritating but ur EA what do I expect from u \nexcept from money gambling .!!!
7684	5	a	Дельное  приложение. Все чётко и грамотно расписано, радуют сквозные ссылки в описании - реально экономят время. Дизайн простоватый, но удобный.
7685	2	a	The UI is so ugly...
7686	5	a	Very good to the first time and I will you have a few days
7687	2	a	Good app love playing it but every so often half the board will go black and can not see dots etc
7688	2	a	Difficult to find numbers with this poping grey fields.
7689	1	a	If ur going to charge a fee for the game, then say so.  Don't lie and say it's FREE when it's NOT!
7690	1	a	It slow also it dosent work properly
7691	3	a	Iv bn playin this game n lovin it until i reached puzzle 47...is there a way 2 solve that board? Can any1 help? I want 2 get 2 the next level N i dont c a possible solution...is it just me or the puzzle? Helpppp!!!!
7692	4	a	კარგია.მაგრამ გრძელდება უსასრულოდ კითხვები რაღაც ლიმიტის მიუხედავად.და კიდევ ადვილად გადახტის მომდევნო კითხვაზე
7693	1	a	I watched the super boring introduction and I was like I already know this stuff and afterwards I couldn't open it, it wouldn't let me do anything but watch the thing again I couldn't do anything the dude said I could do
7694	1	a	Don't waste your phones data on this app, it is NOT worth downloading. The only stores that are even functional are all within the one screen shot of Kansas City, so unless you live there or near it I do not recommend this to anyone.
7695	2	a	4 hours for 1 energy!! Doesn't that take the piss just a bit?? Makes game progress almost unbarable unless you're willing to pay for the courtesy of playing. Oh and having to wait a full day for a whole 5 energy which if your lucky gets a full 5 mins of gameplay just hurts such a well made game.
7696	5	a	Its a great keyboard i'm using it for twitter and other social networks and for texting cousins thank u may Allah swt reward u for it
7697	5	a	Works really well. Great when you are out visiting so you don't need to take monitors with you.
7698	5	a	Best for grammer and vacablory:-)
7699	3	a	Great app but when it is running in background it let's out a little beep every few seconds. And this isn't the alert tone its a different beep altogether. Very annoying, please fix.
7700	1	a	there is no option to display sim or phone contacts..
7701	1	a	"Crazy stupid that this is \free\"" but I have to freaking pay to use it?! Thanks for wasting my time!"""
7702	4	a	We all love this app because you can hide the favorites, call logs, and recents!!! That's what makes this app stand out better than the stock dialer because we all want privacy thank you!! But you haven't had an update in a long time can you please update and make it look a little bit more like the new Samsung S8 dialer the numbers are a little big can you make it where we can resize them and also the setting can you hide it like long pressing the number button that way people can't get into our settings that would be great and make this the perfect app, and we will come back and rate you 5 stars thank you!!!! Rina Moya :-)
7703	1	a	If not default it doesnt work. If set to default my non-hidden contacts txts and calls dont come through. Very poor quality now. Please fix. Galaxy S4.
7704	1	a	Tells me to check my internet connection and try again. Tried using 4G and wifi but have the same problem with both.
7705	5	a	I pray to Jehovah for brother Osola to have more discernment and wisdom .
7706	5	a	Went thru free games, now I play the free daily game.  Wish more was free, absolutely love these games, look forward to daily game! Thanks
7707	1	a	How m I sing up
7708	5	a	This gamenis very fun. It passes time by and it has a little challenge to it.This game is probably  my favorite game ever. If you don't know either to get this game or not I would highly recommend you get it.You won't regret it. Cause this game is awesome. I love it all my friends love it too.The good thing is that you can make different highscores and keep trying to beat them everytime you play.
7709	5	a	been playing the game for 3years now and since SC2 came out it makes me want to play more and love the fact that I can play it on my  4yr old android phone without a problem
7710	1	a	all you can do is drive around
7711	5	a	The game I have been searching for a very long time in the play store... found this and dint expect it to be this good and fun playing.like some review I just needs some more graphics and fine tuning some other stuff or even make it more interactive. To the developer thanks its the best there is as its the only artillery game available.
7712	5	a	App is awesome. I like it so much
7713	1	a	It wouldn't let me open anything else
7714	4	a	Awesome to use with Quick Launch
7715	1	a	Can not choose my country of choice and can't find stations that I whant. Uninstalling
7716	1	a	Not so flippen gud waist of my data to download it :-(
7717	5	a	Thank you for the app developed for Nellore
7718	4	a	This game is pretty good you take care of your own family of owls.when they learn how to fly then they get annoying but other wise its pretty fun
7719	5	a	It's do beautiful and relaxing! And if u touch the text...near the cup...you'll see a splash of creamer or milk perhaps in ur cup! I love it!
7720	4	a	Interesting. Also good to see before you buy a phone what sensors it has so you know if you can play vr games etc.
7721	5	a	I very like This Apps
7722	5	a	"I haven't seen a pirate game quite like this before, but... shiver me timbers [sorry, I had to], this is pretty cool. Not an rpg, or a strategy game so much, but an easygoing musically and visually sufficient old-school seek and destroy interface. I dig the period flags and simple navigation. I have seen other \3583 bytes\"" games become even more intricately detailed and even more interactive over time. I like this one a lot. Keep up the good work!!"""
7723	3	a	Need more levels and destinations
7724	5	a	cool game in the world 👌👌👌
7725	1	a	I can't seem to find it on my S5. How do I start using it?
7726	3	a	I've had this game a few days and played it twice. I like the hieroglyphics and this game occupies my mind.
7727	1	a	Closes immediately after showing a blank white screen ...
7728	5	a	He lives it. Easy to to keep him busy.
7729	5	a	Look's great, we are just a tiny spec of rock..So fragile, yet we still war \nagainst each other. #biggerpicture
7730	5	a	Wow... fast 4D Lottery chinese dictionary :) cool... my dad must like this :P
7731	5	a	for the last year I've had my Note 3?? Lovin' this widget. Worth it to upgrade  for $1 to transparent colors. Thanks a lot.
7732	5	a	Would give 5stars, but the app will stop working at times. Also been a customer of Boost Mobile going 6years. Please fix it!! (Galaxy S2)
7733	3	a	3 out of 5 test results are incorrect like my Mi6 has manual ISO, manual shutter and manual white balance feature inbuilt.
7734	3	a	Die really quick and you don't really make any coin
7735	1	a	They want you to pay for any good videos! And you can find better videos for free on YouTube. Thx anyway, but I uninstalled it pretty quickly after downloading.
7736	1	a	Doesn't work anymore. Get a message that it was made for an older version of android. Running on Android 9.x
7737	1	a	Couldn't even make an account to sign into
7738	5	a	A very good Game i hope there will be never ending hazel
7739	1	a	It doesn't let me choose a line after choosing the bus company. ..
7740	1	a	To slow to many glitches
7741	5	a	Det virker rigtig fint! !
7742	4	a	Does what it described, but can have more features
7743	5	a	Good game for maths type things
7744	3	a	Ability to share folders, or multiple files at once would be invaluable, and would rank this app up higher than it's competitors.
7745	5	a	I really love crocs my mom got me this game for $0.99 really great make more like wild dog simulator and make your games free!!!!
7746	4	a	Need to adjust portrait view only plays landscape mode
7747	4	a	Is a bit strange how a 11 bloke can be 2nd in the world must be cheating a lot. Don't really matter how gd u r in that fact people seem to cheat. But is still a gd game to play.
7748	1	a	CONS: BACK BUTTON BUGGY NOT WORKING properly while playing media. no proxy network feature... no report abuse feature... not many security features. PROS: Media/Gallery show only. Switch off all profile photos, can disable showing media. Can reduce sizes of media displayed. Can load up to 200 messages at once. ... but Tweetcaster used to be much better than Twitter app..but now prefer use Twitter app now. Tweetcaster search is not very good also.. no suggestions to find @ addresses
7749	5	a	I do suggest it for people with eye problems
7750	3	a	Apmokejimas vis dar tragiskas, nepalaiko kredito korteles
7751	5	a	It is a a some trivia game
7752	4	a	as someone who came from the Note Edge to tab s3 i was looking for an app to simulate the edge experience. this apo is the only one i found that comes anywhere close AND looks good. i will definitely upgrade to pro . the only problem i have is that the glovebox unread widget isnt working in combination with the pullout, and that you cant use the home button to hide the pullout, and swiping it away generates copies of the pullout. if these get fixed, that would be a solid 5 star from me :)
7753	1	a	worst thing. playstore need to remove it
7754	1	a	Doesnt even open up when i put it on! Uninstalling until fixed. (If fixed then 5 stars)
7755	3	a	I know it's trivial but having to press the symbol button to get a decimal point when I have lots of figures to calculate drives me mad.  Great shame as otherwise its a good app. Looking for an alternative
7756	1	a	Basic app for advertising and gathering data from you... installed a few apps from this developer and have the same click disclaimer on each one, uninstalled
7757	5	a	Amazing combat game!  This was an amazing experience on the iconic legend.... Bruce Lee! The game was fairly even with the gameplay and the graphics. I have always loved two dimensional graphics, well some might say 3d would look good, but it just wierds me out when they glitch! Well anyway, amazing game, cool graphics, and an amazing gameplay. You have replicated the long time legend as a gameing icon as well.
7758	5	a	Very skeptical at first. Gave it a try and it put me down for a little power nap. Woke me up too. Nice little app. Remember it works best if you're in an environment conducive to sleeping. If you slam an energy drink and expect this app to put you down like that. You're going to be disappointed. I really enjoy this app for a afternoon nap to power me through the rest of a hectic day.
7759	4	a	Wow very nice app i love it
7760	5	a	I loooove this  app its cool
7761	4	a	Notes don't sound so accurate by the way.
7762	1	a	Gick inte att lägga till fordon utan att leta upp pappersbevis och sedan lyckas scanna in koden med kameran. Såklart funkade det inte.  Sämst
7763	4	a	I loved very much . But one problem , if fire ball will be there the goalkeeper will never save it will go back and front
7764	5	a	This is a wonderful memory trainer ... it really gets your mind all geared up and one can actually feel the improvement... all it takes is patience and perseverance.
7765	3	a	The default max volume is highly annoying. It should be preset to our preference.
7766	1	a	Horrible app. Not very fun and hard to nvigate. Sometimes gets frozen too. Sony Ericsson '10. Uninstall
7767	4	a	I've only had this game for a few days, it's fun and makes you think. My only problem is that it has already crashed a few times, freezing my tablet. Hopefully this issues will be resolved .
7768	5	a	So good was happy enough with web version but having on me phone is great. Watch out griefers. WATCH. OUT
7769	3	a	Transacções demasiado caras. Vale mais usar o site de home banking.
7770	5	a	This is a great study guide app for sec+ I used mostly this and professor \nmesser videos to study and I passed no problem. Comes with flash cards as \nwell
7771	5	a	This game is a little like the Terraria, but it add some new ideas in it! It was a very cool game, you should buy it and play it!

7774	5	a	A Yandere whom loves you so much that even hire snipers and the whole AOT squad to watch onto you. What could go wrong?
7775	5	a	Yes! very good, but should be more color.
7776	2	a	The version on iPhone Ain't the same as iPad and android. It's much userfriendlier on my iPhone. The rest are PC versions. An app should not be PC version.
7777	4	a	I want to use the tab key to auto fill the file/folder name in the shell. But i didn't find in my android mobile. Hw can i find the tab key.. plzz any one suggest
7778	3	a	Found a lot of descriptions and icons error in game. Hero pathfinding is rather bugged - click left and the hero goes right
7779	4	a	Best video player for sure. Wen one video is over it auto plays another one. Really superb
7780	5	a	This Game is for kids.
7781	1	a	I've completed up to the point where I go to the cournel and am supposed to be able to tell him I need warm clothes for the monestary and the dialogue box keeps showing the back arrow and no discussion topics so I can't move forward in the game. What a waste of money. REFUND PLEASE!!
7782	5	a	Nice and simpe to use.. and doesnt need any special permissions.. why do other shopping lists need your id info.. or call and media files etc. Makes ya wonder. Anyway top app. its exactly what i needed
7783	5	a	Is good for writing and figuring out Cord structure.
7784	5	a	It reminds me of rush fight where u have to keep on tapping or u die
7785	5	a	Hope u keep making amazing themes like this
7786	3	a	The new USB connection is great but unfortunately doesn't work on Android 4.4. My Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 doesn't have Android, because Samsung didn't update it any more. Is it possible to make the USB option compatible with Android 4?
7787	2	a	" then nothing happened. All I got to see was the names of the 1st 3 winners! Not a single number came up. I'm sitting there like a dummy waiting to start daubing numbers that never came about. I'm about ready to uninstall. This is the 2nd time this has happened to me"""

7789	5	a	Does all you would need with a flashlight. There are two color choices both adjustable that alternate with a touch of the screen. A slide to the right and it's off. Adjustments are made by swiping left. Simple.

7794	2	a	The idea of the app is great, but is not developed. I don't know why there aren't topics aviable for B2 level.
7795	5	a	THIS IS DEFINITELY VANTAS APPROVED. I REALLY NEEDED SOME RELAX TIME IN MY RECUPRACOON AND THIS HELPED A LOT THANKS(all things aside it does help me sleep thanks)
7796	3	a	Control can be frustrating at times and having to completely restart a level sucks.
7797	4	a	So far so good, I can costumes my own samples on this app, but i can't change or load my custom preset faster. I hope you can upgrade this feature for easy way to change costume preset of drum machine. Thanks before
7798	2	a	Moto E Android 5.1 App doesn't work while phone's screen is off. Once I press to unlock (I don't need to actually unlock it), all the pent up events run. If it can be fixed I'll try it again. For now I'm un-installing. To bad because it is a nice simple design.
7799	1	a	Un publicidad que cubre toda la pantalla despues de girar la botella cada 3 veces!!
7800	3	a	... sometimes surprisingly slow switching tiles. I would appreciate an 'airplane mode' switch even without turning GPS and NFC as I don't usually have them on on a plane anyway ;) (S4)
7801	4	a	What I personally think is that there should be a share button that shows what u'v added food wise plus the location of ur mcd's
7802	3	a	Daughter is 2 and has learned so much from this app. Would be better if had multiple  language. Hoping for French.
7803	5	a	I love this game,is very challenging..Horay..I'm finished!!
7804	3	a	The gameplay is fun so far but I feel like the gestures are a bit gimmicky.
7805	3	a	I wish they had more to choose from.
7806	5	a	Hi developers , i hope next update  more on text style, curvy text effects, and have a 3D effects, i hope so. Thank u and God bless.
7807	4	a	I do like it. The game needs a option to offer a draw. The AI for single play is easy to beat but I like the online play. I see a problem when people start a game then abandon it you could end up with a screen full of games you can't finish.
7808	5	a	Great app makes life easier
7809	4	a	Hi, the app is good but needs some correction. Crimea is a Russian Peninsula now, so please correct this. I am not sure whether it will happen or not but please be ready to change maps of Spain, Belgium, Italy and the USA. The rest of stuff is good.
7810	4	a	I've tried hundreds it seems and none fit my needs like this app. So many options and very easy to use. My only request, and reason I continue to search elsewhere for a different notebook app is because I wish there was the option to have different color notes, similar to post it notes. So please please- throw some color to this app! Thank you!
7811	1	a	Don't bother getting this app u don't do anything u just watch them teach u!!!
7812	1	a	"I've been looking long and hard for a good Samba application. I had high hopes for this one... It let me share both my internal and external SD card. My MacBook Pro saw it, and connected. Then I tried to copy a file to it, received the -50 error, and created a blank file. It also seems to disconnect quite often. both devices are within 10 feet of the router, with no other devices to interfere.  Also noticed that the servers I create \only allows guest accounts.\"" that popup message appears when I go into the server settings.  I'm going to try what Robert Weibe said about the Terminal cp command."""
7813	4	a	Good way of killing a few minutes here and there.
7814	1	a	Useless, if I'm home there's no need for this app. Why would I need to \ncontrol my tv away from home if I'm not there to watch? When I'm home I \nhave the remote to use. You can't set recordings from this app, so \npointless if it doesn't have ALL features that the actual remote has. \nUninstalling.

7818	5	a	Loved this game as a kid. UI is better in many ways. Only one issue I see, no way to quickly move between spells, which makes the spell dependant classes feel weaker. Please try to allow for more spell slots for caster dependant characters.
7819	2	a	Please put this game in online mode Loggin in with fb
7820	3	a	Looks fun. Need way more baggage space or more class specific gear. Takes too long to level, to increase stats, to be able to use gear. Strafing would be a nice touch too. Will continue playing.
7821	5	a	It like its my on baby
7822	4	a	I wonder if you include the word search. Other than that I like It.
7823	1	a	NOT FREE!!!!! I am NOT going to pay for a stupid theme!!!
7824	5	a	It's so cool... I knew only some words now thanks to you guys I'm knowing better...
7825	1	a	I hate it so much
7826	3	a	Imagens incoerentes, dicas muito caras, muitas propagandas e o enigma diário é muito simples, mas gostei muito do jogo, eu o zerei em dois dias e estou esperando fases novas... Espero que reparem esses pequenos erros.  Enfim, o jogo é sim muito bom, mas precisa de reparos.
7827	5	a	I expect bug fixes, crash fix, optimization and also more improvements. Good luck!
7828	5	a	Not even money can change beauty....lol
7829	2	a	Sorry, but not receiving data at present.
7830	5	a	This is my overall favorite live wallpaper for its unique style and techy appearance not to also forget the main purpose, to show the status of your phone or tablet. I'd recommend this to people who love futuristic/technological type of apps. One thing I'd appreciate (and perhaps other users) is if the wallpaper can cut down on the RAM usage since it builds up to 70-80% on the device, thus slowing down performance dramatically.
7831	5	a	Love playing the slots on here and a good variety!👍
7832	5	a	y'all jack it so stupid
7833	3	a	Game crashes and won't let me do level 2 picture 7
7834	5	a	Better payout please. Game is great even in 2D. But grinding is a nightmare.
7835	3	a	The frames per second is really bad in this game but in all a nice game to play and is defiantly worth the money! Thanks devs!! But!! PLEASE FIX THE FPS!!!
7836	4	a	Hey it would be very nice if this app lets us change the time for update. For my phone I want to see new verses every morning after I wake up around 6 am. I hope you guys could put it up in the nee update, love the app! ill give 5 if I can edit time for update. :)
7837	4	a	Maybe can have video to teach
7838	5	a	It's a wonderful site but today it's not working
7839	5	a	Nope im just kidding!! Its fun
7840	5	a	I love it it's so cute🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶
7841	2	a	Awful. Two stars for comedy value though.
7842	1	a	This has potential for an interesting game, but really disappointing with this tiny screen.  Uninstalling.  Sad.
7843	1	a	fix uninstall,, bete bgt disaat ga bs ngevote gegara server error.. mubazir talent bagus bnyak yg lepas
7844	5	a	Nice game and great control download it today
7845	1	a	It worked but after the next 3 days it not work
7846	5	a	It is CLEARLY in another language. If you don't like it don't play it. Plain and simple. STUPID.
7847	5	a	I so love this game never played this games for yonks, old gameshop days ;)
7848	1	a	I did not like it like when I deleted stuff it came back worst game ever😠😠😠😠😠😡😡😡😡😬😬😬😲😲😲😲😲 please fix it
7849	1	a	Not enough cards and time goes very fast. Not worth the download.
7850	5	a	I love the sound of it, it can be challenging but is a fairly easy game. Wish we could change the background. My highest score is 118
7851	2	a	It keeps pops up the need to download Chinese handwriting plug-in thingy, pls fix it
7852	4	a	I like this app. Not only they have frames, but more you can down load and have. I was looking for an app that had some fall frames. This one has three, so that made it for me. Would have five stars, but I tried using the trash. But it doesn't work.
7853	5	a	From this app my mental calculation is now better
7854	2	a	I would give this a better rating if I could get the current edition. It's available online and on shelves but not in their own app yet?
7855	2	a	good game but kills you when your not even touching the screen
7856	2	a	No customization unless you buy which you will be reminded
7857	5	a	I have learnt lots of basic programming with this
7858	5	a	I hooked the trailer up
7859	1	a	Very bad not work my phone
7860	5	a	Ok but need more and more again update
7861	5	a	" which I think is TOO CHEAP – Snap is so good. :-) Thank you."""
7862	5	a	Interesting game, I like the spaceships!
7863	5	a	It helped me and my family get rid of spirits in our new house.😊 Thx for \nthe awesome app.
7864	3	a	Its cool but it also bad!?🤓🤑☹
7865	2	a	Controls r very bad.. Please improve the controls n game.. Make it a little easy..
7866	2	a	It doesn't work on my phone is it not aloud for LG's?
7867	5	a	Wow!!! Awesome game!! I Highly Recommended to all!!
7868	1	a	It is very boring game Do not waste your time.
7869	3	a	I can not download...  why
7870	3	a	I enjoy this game because it is making my brain work. I feel 500 levels for one level is a bit much. I feel every 30 levels accomplished the player should earn something.m
7871	5	a	very nice, any, medical personnel, dealing with iv drips can use it to best advantage, specially, anesthesia, and paediatric speciality
7872	2	a	This game is sooo  dumb
7873	3	a	Pls. help me redsolution I am getting again \u0026 again connection error\u0026 my server is xmpp.jp
7874	5	a	Born to be proud to be Indian, Jai Hind
7875	4	a	No longer work, no network connection, doesn't update... Please fix....  I've using this app since 2012/2013... convenient especially for travelers... functions was perfect for me... hope the developer updates it soon... ashame to lose it...
7876	5	a	Este jogo é muito bom, ele influencia o individuo a ter um bom raciocínio
7877	4	a	Its a good game and all its just that its very hard to control so can you please fix the controls on the game plz but I love this game
7878	1	a	Ti is boring i hate it
7879	5	a	now i can make perfect eggs every time!
7880	4	a	"Нужное приложение, спасибо автору. Хотелось бы у виджета видеть надпись \доставлено\"" вместо надписи \""обработка\"" когда посылка доставлена. И еще возможность посмотреть время последней проверки. А так все хорошо."""
7881	3	a	You guys need to open up the new levels. I'm pretty upset that i spent a little money to buy good guns and then hit a brick wall when i tried to advance to the next level.
7882	5	a	Great game \u0026 fun for all.
7883	3	a	Why i cannot use skyline R34
7884	4	a	This is an amazing app and I have been playing chess on this app since past 2 years.  However,  there's a bug in the app which is pretty annoying and I have reported that bug too to them. Sometimes,  when you are playing a game with somebody and when they make a move,  you get a notification.  As soon as you open it,  you can see the chess  board in all one color which is black.  Instead of being able to see the chess board in black and white or whatever color you have chosen,  you see it in all black.
7885	5	a	Not yet to try..but i feel it is very useful
7886	5	a	That was awsome game i ever seen
7887	1	a	It would be better if it didn't start you all over when you lose
7888	3	a	It is very hard for me to control the guys. Needs practising.
7889	3	a	Not bad...and its more than better air controler
7890	3	a	The pictures are so irrelevant to the phrases it's hysterical
7891	5	a	Wish theres also for sms themes
7892	5	a	A great time killer, probably the best multiplayer game, great controls, \ndownload this game but i request the developers to update a make more games.
7893	1	a	Not work on micromax a089.
7894	5	a	THE BEST SLOT🌟  I LOVE THIS GAMES😘 THANKS FOR THIS GAME I GIVE⭐⭐⭐ 100 ⭐⭐STARS
7895	1	a	Does not work hate it already
7896	1	a	COULD NOT EVEN LOAD CORRECTLY.
7897	3	a	It is a great app. But one problem is it does not move forward.
7898	3	a	Game play is decent but when all progress is lost when it gets interupted its quite annoying. Also I m able to use gold to build structures but why won't my leftover silver be lost completely? Only one tower to hit air units? Why?
7899	5	a	Great app, it just saved me from getting headached trying to set up my apn. Very user friendly
7900	2	a	Its a pretty good game but i absolutely hate the scoring on it
7901	5	a	Everything is good, but the tools menu. The title at the top left is too big,  maybe just left the app icon there and add a group of icon tools bar(without text) at the right side, that will be more user friendly.  If you can let user to save the last setting (e.g. stroke thickness,  draw shape from corner to corner)  and using multi-touch to control zoom pan action will better too,.
7902	5	a	The stereo systems but it nice
7903	5	a	I like it is what I need
7904	5	a	Great concept, I have no idea how to build a custom kernel. Any chance you could make one for Galaxy Tab S2 ?
7905	5	a	At last a breakout style game where I can smash lots of bricks and don't get bored trying to get the last few. Bril idea, thanks.
7906	5	a	Nexus 6p/Huawei watch. Great app, brilliant. Takes a few minutes to show up on your watch. Well it did for mine. I rated this one star and right after I submitted it popped up on my watch.
7907	3	a	Good but it need the voices based on their expression. Is too silenced
7908	2	a	Not practical when limited to 10 minutes and authentication requires a \nresponse to an email...a text message/response setup would be way more \npractical.
7909	5	a	This game is really fun. Thanks for giving us all the level packs for free!!!
7910	2	a	Rising air should not be highlighted, instead show clouds and provide the chirp of a vario! You could also add general wind and therefore areas of ridge lift. Include much larger maps and provide tasks for users to complete. Finally make it multiplayer and allow for over-the-web competitions and you would have an instant hit! I'd certainly pay for that!
7911	5	a	The game's awesome but you need to implement Cloud Save like your other games.
7912	4	a	A great little app that let's you apply retro filters to your photos as you take them - select the camera style and then the filter style. I recommend the paid-for version to banish the adds. The downside is that it can be a little slow and there is no option to save to SD card.
7913	5	a	شكرا جزيلا لكل من ساهم في هذا البرنامج وجزاكم الله كل الخير
7914	2	a	Looks great and battery use seems fine.  Easy set up.  Sometimes the weather conditions don't update correctly or it will show it sunny at midnight  (it seems better now)..but I noticed on the Noaa site, they were wrong, too, so it may be a source of the info error rather than the app.  The temp seems accurate mostly.  EDIT 7/25.  stuck 2 days  behind...no refresh
7915	1	a	I also in game content only to have my money taken and receive nothing. Pretty irritating, but to make matters worse, the dev will not respond to email contact. So it looks like they aren't willing to take responsibility. Supremely disappointed.
7916	3	a	Liked the game play, nice visuals, but very frustrating when the game forceccloses because there are no matches in some levels
7917	5	a	Thank you! I haven't been able to make or receive calls for days. I was ready to give up and then I found this app! I was able to acces phone info and change the preferred network type and this fixed the issue. Calls are now clear as water. I wasn't able to acces this through other apps or my phones stock settings.
7918	1	a	This app does not work I've tried everything
7919	4	a	Thank you so much for a beautiful \u0026 graceful app. I am blessed for it!!
7920	5	a	Love this App. Quick and easy!
7921	1	a	Uploads contacts it chooses not the ones I want. Uninstall
7922	5	a	Awesome. Perfect for my screen and definitely the best
7923	2	a	match making sucks, connection to server always a problem and i kept losing my monster due to connection.. please fix it. until then i give 3*

7927	3	a	I'm loving it's comforteble \u0026 fethful app
7928	5	a	I have a few recommendations 1. The devs show cars other than the default one and no way to unlock them if there is then at least have an unlockables menu . 2. A separate currency for the new maps and upgrades of you do this people won't go should I buy a map or upgrade.  3. Back to the cars MORE MORE MORE MORE there is only one car that I can play as and it's making me board, or at least more customization on the car(s)
7929	5	a	Ótimo para quem não tem opinião própria! Já dá tudo mastigado e você só precisa repetir como um papagaio! Currupaco!
7930	5	a	Nice app good job to developer
7931	5	a	Dont work with android p
7932	3	a	I live in third world coutry. I know how it feels with so called poverty, wars, lack of chance in finding good jobs etc. Just need to make this game more interesting to play.
7933	4	a	Please provide old version voice.
7934	5	a	Pak sarzameen shadbaad. I also love ur country like I love my country. Someone said that he hates Hindu culture. Here in India different culture in different states. Even I don't know everything about Hindu. So. Don't judge everything by knowing little. Respect all culture except those who can't show respect other. Love you all indopak rock
7935	1	a	I've only hooked 1 fish. Every time bobber goes under it says fail instantly.
7936	3	a	My kid gets really disappointed when the quiz doesnt allow enough time for her to find the letter. The voice is hard to understand on some letters too
7937	5	a	Thank you for this app!! This works perfectly with my virtual dj 7 pro!! One thing i wish for this app, make this app usb driven, not over WIFI connection!!
7938	5	a	This app is great.. I recommended people who like fancy fonts to use this app, it's great!
7939	2	a	Network problem in arena...not working....its my suggestion to DroidHen to please correct this problem otherwise people will not play and ultimately ur game will decline..please bug fix it...many people have talked about this problem but you do not pay any attention..please do pay..
7940	1	a	Can't get it to work :((
7941	5	a	You will have great inspiraion for real life parties

7944	1	a	As much as a love cabelas I hate their app. It's very difficult to find anything and clumsy to use. Cabelas I love you but your app needs to be totally reworked.
7945	5	a	I found the interface nice, simplistic and displaying what is needed. New timer profiles can be created for different situations but it's not possible to set different times for the players. Nor can the sound from ending turn be muted. Overall the best free chess clock I've tried.
7946	1	a	Won't allow you to add TV provider.
7947	5	a	Great app for married people
7948	1	a	I hate it. It just shows the first photo you toom
7949	4	a	"in the app, the name of this theme is \material dark red\"". it has a circle play/pause button. but here it is charcoal dark red which is very different than the former one."""
7950	5	a	Very satisfying wallpaper. Makes a great home screen by itself.
7951	1	a	It says its installed on the play store but when I click on it it says it isn't installed
7952	3	a	Handig, maar ik mis heel erg de mogelijkheid om competities als favoriet op te slaan. Om bvb Eredivisie te volgen
7953	5	a	Asks for what it needs and does what you need. Widget also work well and is responsive. (budget friendly mid-to-low-range Allview P5, Android 4.0.4 ICS)
7954	1	a	:(:(:( Do not get this if your under 18
7955	5	a	It's a very fun and time consuming. Also my class got I pads and we got to play  it and I wanted  to do download it on my tablet. This game is very fun.
7956	1	a	Screw dis game it creepes hell out of me it sucks
7957	3	a	The apps is nice, but no Friday Massages
7958	5	a	Love it to the mass
7959	1	a	Game either won't load or when you try to connect to Facebook it won't load......what gives?
7960	2	a	"It's a very good app in theory, this one had far too many bugs. It is hard to return to the list of restaurants in your area without having the \to many connections\"" message. Please invest more time in the development of this app."""
7961	3	a	This game is nice but why only two games in it
7962	1	a	The app keeps saying it's not installed even though I am clicking on it.
7963	4	a	Its really good! Thumbs up
7964	4	a	This is an absolutely amazing app for reducing the file size of videos. \nEven when you are transcoding to the same resolution. Though you can do \n1080 to 1080 you can't do 4K to 4K sadly
7965	2	a	" continua a existir um intervalo de tempo no qual é possível aceder aos dados do banco sem a necessidade de conhecer o pin. Isto resolver-se-ia se a sessão expirasse também quando a aplicação perde o foco"""
7966	1	a	It is alright but once you finished the four levels it gets a bit boring.

7970	1	a	It is a very boring game , dont download this game
7971	5	a	Nice one but 1.0 I  expect more better when its updated
7972	3	a	But you must translet multi language example bahasa malaysia.
7973	5	a	Running Android 5.0 on Galaxy S5 I have no access to the Preferences as Samsung did away with the Menu button. Edit: works fine now I've found how to access the context menu (press \u0026 hold on new multitasking / recent apps key)
7974	3	a	I really love this game. However, it's very small on my Galaxy Note 3, they have the display ratio off. The village covers the whole screen, but the tiles are really small, as is the hero selection screen. You have to squint to see it.
7975	5	a	unique frames for photos, they look magnificent
7976	1	a	Zaglavuva aplikacijata I via slikite sto se od raskrsnici ne se pregledni Taka samo da si strakas.. Aj moze ke se uprave so nekoj update

7980	5	a	Keep up the good work and don't let those 1 star reviews, made by people who should use shovels and hoes, instead of technology put you down!  Thanks for making the app ad-free!
7981	1	a	Developer seems to have given up on supporting this app
7982	4	a	I think it's cool and all, but there's really no gameplay. I can get by \nthis, as it is advertised as a written story. But I can't get past the fact \nthat you need energy to read 20 seconds worth of plot. And to get energy, \nyou either pay a us dollar for one crystal to trade for one energy, or wait \nfour hours for 1 energy. I love the story so far, but I strongly dislike \nthe energy mechanic.
7983	2	a	Kalau phone dalam keadaan silent, suaranya tidak muncul. Opsi waktu kurang fleksibel.
7984	4	a	UPDATE: They FINALLY pushed out the SwannView version for Lollipop. Everything is working as it should now. However, they are going to have to earn that 5th STAR back for what they put us through.                                  Same as others have posted. This app stopped working after upgrading to Lollipop 5.1 on Droid Turbo 64. Hope fix will be out soon. Gonna contact Lorex Support directly.
7985	3	a	I love the way this theme is. I just hate the color..
7986	4	a	I've always wanted to try smoking.
7987	1	a	Controls are terrible! You can either take a sharp left or a sharp right, no such thing as going straight!
7988	4	a	great app for my google tv
7989	5	a	One of the most useful apps on my entire phone. I use this more than most things I have even paid for. Outstanding common sense app. Put out a pay one so I can import and export lists. That would be useful!
7990	4	a	Travell comfortable.. Any time in hand to see panchang
7991	1	a	Don't waste your time. It's  a crap! Most of the books don't have a price, and when they're  interested  only offer 1 dollar or less.
7992	2	a	בשביל מה צריך לבחור את הקופונים?
7993	1	a	"Well, it only showed the she'll one. Plus it didn't even show \water drops\""  just moving water."""
7994	5	a	It's a cool and effective workout app
7995	5	a	I love this game. This is my favorite type of game. The only thing i ask \nis: please make this game controller compatible. I prefer to use a \ncontroller when i play, because it is easier to control.
7996	2	a	It tells me if I want more kids, then I have to update it, and everytime I do it it says the game has now stopped working, and I restart the phone and it still keeps stopping the game. Never been so aggravated with any game before😤😠😡
7997	3	a	won't open on droid charge.   not bad thing just doesn't work for me.
7998	1	a	Crap dosent even work they just stand ther and dont move at all

8002	5	a	Great app,  I loved the status and the (call me) options. It would be nice if you add built-in lullabies to the app
8003	1	a	Absolutely. Rubbish. Tried 4 apps above this and at least they did something.but also nonsense. After all... Phones and apps are great, but if you want to weigh small quantities of herbs and spices.. Buy a cheap digital. Scale.
8004	5	a	Now my phone is very beautiful for the Christmas season weeeeeeee
8005	4	a	My children love this game because is  past time Game
8006	5	a	Супер если был бы поиск по болезни -)
8007	4	a	too bad it made me buy it in order to continue but i guess it does make sence. its was developed to create profit afterall. loved it so much i bought it :D
8008	4	a	Basic alphabets should be taught
8009	3	a	Fun game but to many ads fix that and I will give 5 stars.😐
8010	5	a	IT IS A VERY FUN GAME, ONCE YOU HAVE A STRATEGY, TO KNOCK OUT THE COLORS!!!
8011	5	a	Set callback number, your Callcentric name and password and that's it.
8012	5	a	Great App. God bless us.
8013	5	a	Works great. Generate qrcodes did your WiFi networks to more easily share \nyour WiFi with friends. Edit: wish it had move to sdcard functionality.
8014	5	a	Its so pretty. I love that you can change globe backgrounds and music. My whole family likes this app!  I keep it all year through.
8015	2	a	Does not support dual sim cards
8016	3	a	Way too many adds!  I guess it's good but the Arabic I learned in Kuwait is pretty different. Not sure what dialect this is.
8017	4	a	Works now, before I would get a memory error. I'll have to find some time to get into it! But I'm happy it works. Thx
8018	1	a	I was hoping when this became an app that I could use it. I do not have a computer. I use my smart phone and tablets only. Playon is useless to me. I thought it would help me cut my cable. But it is useless without a computer.
8019	5	a	I only use the free audio feature and I fall asleep within minutes. I have not had any nightmares since I've been using this app!
8020	5	a	Love It !!  ♡ ♡
8021	4	a	I quite like this game like the other evolution games
8022	4	a	It's a challenging game and interesting also........

8024	5	a	" now leave it be.  Ty!"""
8025	4	a	I downloaded this specifically to listen to Fnoob which for some reason doesn't work. Still a decent app. Listened to a couple of the other stations in the list, none really impressed me. Hoping to find a decent one.
8026	5	a	Keeps my little girl entertained for quite a while.

8031	1	a	But that's beside the point; this game is awful. Slow and bland, and the graphics are blurry. Not to mention an ad with cover up the back button in the Options menu.
8032	5	a	The old classic cherry machine, it's great!
8033	4	a	I love the fact that you can undo your screw-ups, but i think the hunger is way to frequent. Every 5-10 turns I'm already starving to death.
8034	5	a	Awsome its nice for my phone... Love it
8035	5	a	I love the game by the why im his daughter im 9
8036	4	a	Enjoy! Great game, very addictive!
8037	2	a	I love this theme but i cant use it
8038	5	a	AWESOME! Prepping for my 1st competition and needed a GREAT AB WORKOUT and 8 days to my competition I FOUND IT!!!! 💖💖💖💖
8039	5	a	It's very useful, it goes beyond the basic metronome

8043	1	a	It doesn't work. I sign in on the sony website but nothing happens, it staus disconnected...tried everything  but no success, i really want to play the game with the companion..
8044	1	a	The application could not the exam which I have registered and study material section is not being started
8045	3	a	Lately when  S4 phone reboots all notes lost?? Loved it before. HELP. Don't want to delete.Paid for full version, perfect till now???
8046	3	a	I like games like this or Bakery S pretty much, anyway, I think teamlava could do better. First, they just keep updating. It's hard to keep with these and the missions are just for a limited time. Second, gems. If you want to speed up recipes, gems. If you want to buy some things, gems. But, those gems can't be earned. You can only buy them with real money or installing other games. Change that and make it easier, and DON'T UPDATE SO FAST. This will make the games better.

8049	5	a	Very nice. Quickened the pace of the game, frees up a lot of space when playing, and the layout is very intuitive. Would be nice to get mythos cards or and Investigator tracker section (for money, counters, skill summary, etc) in there as well, but I understand the issues. I still find it worth all 5 stars.
8050	5	a	Love N L k s
8051	1	a	Nothing, and I mean NOTHING from Sony will work.  Spend $3,000 on a TV from them?  HA!  You won't even get the features of a $30 chromecast or fire stick.   Screen mirroring?  HAHA!  Forget it!  I used to be a loyal Sony customer. From now on, I will buy anything BUT sony.  Including playstation.   I must have in excess of $20,000 of Sony products in my house.  Not including everything else I've bought over the last 2 decades.  Hell, their own products don't even work with THEIR PRODUCTS!!!
8052	3	a	This game made most of my google apps and phone glitchy. Plus it keeps popping my google play games and it's very laggy. But I loved the dragon designs and artwork.

8056	5	a	Esta app ayuda a guiar mejor a mis alumnos, THANKS!!!
8057	4	a	I enjoy this game a lot. It's different, but in a good way. It's action packed, but requires thinking. It isn't mindless dragon killing. Excellent graphics and gameplay, but only one problem I've encountered. When holding the block button, it sometimes let's go really early and only allows you to tap it. I've gotten killed quite a few times because of this. For a fix, I'll give five stars for sure.
8058	5	a	Use almost daily in clinical practice as a PCP. The patient info entry seems a little cumbersome post update, not sure how to rectify that.
8059	5	a	Great and lots of fun
8060	4	a	Love this theme, the one down fall is it made me pay for it twice when I switched phones.
8061	3	a	Update just added a eBay calc white startup page that is a waste of 2 seconds.  I shouldn't have updated.

8066	1	a	De fleste vil se TVnyheter eller direktesending. Ellevilt mye klikking før man er i mål - i en ekstern app! Elendig streaming, hvorfor ikke like bra eller bedre enn Taaengs  ex-app?
8067	5	a	I spent an entire evening testing dice rolling apps to use with our Pathfinder game.  I like this one the best.  I have been using it for several months now.  The profiles and programable dice are fantastic.  I have all my attacks and skills programed in for several different characters in several different game systems.
8068	5	a	Easy and does what it's supposed to.
8069	1	a	... has such bad controls sometimes it is faster to rotate the table than the current block. Annoying ads made the game unplayable. Uninstalled after 5 minutes.
8070	5	a	It's not exactly fancy, but I love being able to know the city and state a caller is from. It helps me filter out spam.
8071	3	a	How can I rate if not played yet?

8074	3	a	Its OK but some buttons don't work
8075	5	a	It ok if you play it
8076	5	a	Exellent. Here is more stars!!! ******************************
8077	5	a	I decided on Wrote over the paid app Lecture Notes because it has a stroke eraser. Ruled eraser is also nice but I seldom use it. I wish I could change the default eraser to stroke eraser. That is my only complaint. With just a little playing with the settings, I got this app to do everything I wanted. I disabled zooming, but left on two-finger scrolling.

8083	1	a	Disconnects after about an hour without notice.  I wasted my money.  I want my money back.  Plus only one device can be used. This is crap. This does not work,  ceased to work,  it's just a money maker for these people.

8087	5	a	OMG BEST APP EVER THANKS SO MUCHHHH THANKS FOR THE APP I TOTALLY NEED THIS ONG THANK YOU SO MUCH IT WORK PERFECTLY
8088	4	a	Works great. Very neat. Helps track online. Would be 5/5 for the basic version if you could also see you daily progress or just your whole progress.
8089	5	a	Can't decide between this one and Bubble Break by the same developer, they're equally good, think I just prefer the rounded look of the bubbles of Bubble Break over this apps' more button-like look of the bubbles.   Think the developer actually has the picture at the top of each app install page reversed.  Relaxing, fun, keeps 5 personal scores, recommend both apps.
8090	2	a	Are all these reviews fake, paid for, or bots or something?  This game sucks.  Graphics are something you'd expect from 20 years ago.  Gameplay is against the AI only, but I guess that sets it apart from most others that are multiplayer.  Whether that's good depends on you, but I don't like it.  And there's ads AND they want you to buy the game.  The free version is just a demo,  you have to purchase to unlock the full game.  Oh wait,  there's 2 versions for purchase.  Which one do you pick?  Idk,  it's not explained.  Nothing really is in the game.  Uninstalled.  Devs, I'd offer suggestions, but honestly you'd be better off starting from scratch than trying to fix this.
8091	5	a	Funciona de maravilla en mi teléf., llevo tiempo usando esta app y nunca he tenido problema alguno. Excelente.
8092	4	a	I love the basic application.  I wish it gave you a true calculation of the amortization . Most if my customers have questions either about thr monthly breakdown or tiyal interest paid at certain point of the loan.  If I know they need this a head of time I dont even bother with this app.

8101	5	a	I simply love it. Great, addictive and fun to play.
8102	5	a	I love it but at the time that I got it all the designs were free because I got it as free ap of the day. So I am disappointed that now I have to pay for what I got in the beginning as free.
8103	1	a	Game is okay but when you have one big ad across the screen stop you from helping some of the animals.almost impossible to help the animal unless the ad is removed.wow my kid is hooked.so they crying cause they want to help the animal but now I'm force to buy just so they can help the animal.what way to prey on  little kids and their emotions to force the parents to pay for it  no way thats wrong and what more wrong is how Google let's it.Okay with ads but not when they force you to pay just to play 4 free.
8104	5	a	I like and love it.

8124	4	a	Its honestly a fun and decent game. I have been looking for a good flight simulator and this one is very good however its not without its faults. My one gripe is i wish the missions were actually missions. Like they give you Coast Guard planes and the like so i sort of wish the missions you play had merit or actual things to do. Like deliver medicine to base camp with the coast guard plane or use the water plane to get passengers to the cruise ship. Stuff like that would've made this game top notch. Otherwise its a nice little relaxing flight simulator.

8154	4	a	I like the polling for various rooms in the house. Very simple to use.  The best use is help deciding which channel to use. I used to have frequent disconnects because of interference. Switched channels and my connection is much more stable.  I wish houses were constructed for centralized wifi. Luckily they have repeaters if you arent gaming.

8163	4	a	Pretty dope but the wait is unbearable. Try other gif apps if this one takes to long.
8164	1	a	Pop-up ads made the game completely unplayable! It's a shame: I started getting into it on the 1st level, but every time I tapped on an object, an ad popped up an redirected me to the website, which I then had to exit out of, go back into the game, only to have another ad pop up and do the whole thing over again! Very frustrating!!! Didn't play past level 2. Not worth the download at all!!! Now I don't want to download anything from Amphibious Developers eithe; and some of the games look really cool too 😔

8175	2	a	It gave me 100 points to start. When I played, it did not register my wins, I very quickly ran out of points. What a game. Glad I did not buy chips before I tried the game.
8176	5	a	I really love the graphics. It's a great game for boys; my nephew loves it!
8177	2	a	It was alright but too often although I was tapping a find it took too many tries \u0026 I'd run out of time.
8178	1	a	Level after lvl no upgrading your bike it's just the same thing over and over
8179	4	a	Fairly user friendly. Would like to see a breakdown of what tasks have been 'paid' and which are 'billable' without having to run a report or go into each individual task - on the main overview page of the project would be nice. (if this is already possible, I haven't figured out how yet!)
8180	3	a	Love the design but it doesn't change exactly like the one shown for the expansion, just the regular dodol launcher. I've tried many times to get it look like it but it stays the same.

8189	2	a	Okay a lot of people say this game is awesome and yeah it is a really fun game but what sucks is every time you exit out of the game you lose all your levels even if the tab still open so there's no point in a game like that cuz you have to start over from training again so Critter Escape sucks

ABSOLUTELY 5 STARS! - Without a doubt, one of the best Apps ever created, in my opinion. - Flawless UI design \u0026 visually perfect layout. - This App displays all of the most important details in a simple to understand fashion. I love these great system Apps \u0026 I wish I found this sooner. I've used hundreds of these Android OS Apps and I am writing this to let you know that this is honestly superb. You even get a nice widget included. A big THANKS to the developer! - Very underrated!
8207	5	a	It's a cool game to play
8208	1	a	After you've leveled up just about everything, there's literally nothing to spend them dumb coins on. You then can only rely on kitty coins and it's pretty much a waste of time trying to get them. The only ways are purchasing them at a ridiculous amount, waiting for your daily bonus--mine was only 18, playing a round for 2 coins, or hoping you land on the free spinner. Oh but regular coins? I have 50000 with nothing to do with them!
8209	3	a	Lock screen ... and set password does not works properly..plz fix this
8210	4	a	a really great app with a nice UI but it lacks synchronization with Google Health.. would be awesome if you can add that to the app - also auto checking the heart rate for smart watches would make the app perfect 👌
8211	1	a	I cant bring any song on it. Please do not download it. it is the wastage of time.
8212	5	a	I really like this app. It has helped me become more organized and productive. I wish there was an overview that could be split by clients, but that is a minor thing. I haven't taken the time to figure out the reports, but I will get to that eventually.

8229	4	a	Snow globe great for holidays think some of bad remarks cause person didn't know how to load personal pictures save and send them....I don't use as wallpaper so can not comment on that
8230	2	a	I used to love this app. But its getting so slow. Took lots of ram. Take lots of time to open pics in DM also refresh limit make app unusable
8231	4	a	I use this app to judge distances while out shooting. I find it very accurate.
8232	3	a	It s good app but how we stich this app doesn't give good idea it gives help but so so.......
8233	5	a	Author continues to develop this app to keep it the BEST of its genre. Blame problems on crappy phones, this app is perfecto! - Atrix 4G 2.3.6

8235	5	a	Simple and so far perfect. I have a default app called Memo on my Tab A which performs perfectly This is almost identical for my Galaxy s3, but took a little searching for.
8236	5	a	I love this game you run and crash into stuff
8237	5	a	Great heart card game love it, hope you please it to Apple devices \neventually that would be cool
8238	4	a	Sometimes reports wrong speed limit otherwise is a very good ap.
8239	4	a	Works well and very useful. I find recording hours on the jobs and pausing for breaks an ideal way to monitor one's efficiency. Recording and charging phone calls is the one activity I have been able to achieve easily now which I did not do before this app. Invoice summary is great way to summarise charges for invoicing, but found it confusing to set up. Some functions are confusing at first. I'm used to it now and like it a lot.
8240	3	a	It was fine but it was kind of easy. They should have harder answers to pick from
8241	3	a	It's nice theme but I don't like advertising on my phone un installed. I'll just buy the ones with no advertising.
8242	5	a	I like this themes alsooo .... supp and mars moon loved it sooooooo
8243	4	a	Good controls and graphics. Couldn't solve lvl 6. Need to show where zombies last saw you, with a question mark or a shade of the character. Otherwise it's mostly guesswork
8244	4	a	" check your Internet\"". Please fix and it'll be 5 stars!"""
8245	5	a	I use xperia x20I ,after upgrade to mod rom gingerbread, my camera is broken cannot save the picture. And then iam try all camera apk in market... and just your aplication can I use.. iam sorry bad english lgng.
8246	3	a	Now it searches for a while then a blank search page, shame because was good initially
8247	5	a	Nice game very good gamr
8248	4	a	It did what it supposed to.. but it was slow when 50+ contacts were selected all and put up for merge took around 5 mins.. Galaxy S4
8249	3	a	Bad if your device does not vibrate
8250	5	a	update dong dan harusnya bisa memilih character di level apapun tanpa bayar tolong level terbarunya dan online nya mohon untuk menambahkan character menjadi 6
8251	1	a	Great idea.  Too bad the app doesn't connect at all.
8252	1	a	All the sounds the same ..has nothing to do with minions
8253	1	a	I can't even open it!
8254	2	a	DAFUQ why would someone but a plane just to see how to make it?
8255	5	a	This is better than the iPhone calender icon. You can have multiple icons that shows different calenders. Awesome! 6 Stars!!! It would be better still if the Chinese calendar date is shown in Chinese.
8256	5	a	Best game ever and I think people should play this and then Dungeon Nightmares so they can get a feal for the game.Make a update so that you can have a gun or sword please.
8257	4	a	I really enjoy this game, sucks me in, and is a great time killer. Though I've not figured out the hint system yet. The only thing that I don't like is how crowded my screen gets with elements while playing. Makes it a bit difficult, more so than I'd like, but not enough to stop playing.
8258	4	a	Can be repetitive hunting for coins.  But brings back nostalgia from my childhood days playing games like starfox64 and rogue squadron. While everyone fought over the new xbawx.
8259	4	a	App seemed to get enough things right that I quickly bought the full version. Has plenty of illustrated exercises, is designed for fast log entry and stat tracking, tracks personal bests with trophies, and seems to support notifications and workout schedules. One quick suggestion to the dev: use a prettier theme for the screenshots! I passed on this app multiple times until I had tried like 30 other apps. The gray theme is decent.
8260	3	a	Great game but so annoying that there's an ad after every page you complete. A real pain
8261	3	a	Its okay.. But i suggest please add more new songs and other old songs so we can enjoy this app. And some songs can't play till the end of the songs. Thanks.. God bless..
8262	1	a	I do not like to write bad comments, but this app is the worts among all I tried before. It blocked my phone few time, and accuracy is 0%.
8263	4	a	It is unvelievable that you guys thought of simple concept and made it fun and enjoyable keep it up guys!
8264	4	a	Please add the month OTtype.(like the day and week option).
8265	2	a	This app is in foreign language not english so hard to use
8266	5	a	I loved the game but not how Sam and Dean look like
8267	4	a	Very easy 35 mini escapes. You don't need to know Japanese except stage 30. Difficulty 1.5 stars
8268	5	a	He dont even show me a ad for a mile is kidding us guys download it if he have ads close wifi
8269	5	a	I can't get how to use it
8270	5	a	I love My India and also Pakistan
8271	3	a	Why does a widget need permission to access my files? There's no reason. I won't update.
8272	5	a	This help me on my test and it very helpful for me😂😂
8273	1	a	It wont let me search for sections it keeps stopping please fix and i will give it more stars but in till then it sucks
8274	1	a	I can't even search any gif i want
8275	4	a	Love the functionality, but could you consider updating the engine to the \nrecent 1.7 version? GOG installers are currently extracted to non \nreassembled directories.
8276	4	a	Loved the game but had to keep reloading. Gave up in the end
8277	1	a	OK if it costs at least say that it will.
8278	1	a	Absolute garbage app. Did you even check it's functionality before \nreleasing it? Doesn't always even open. Like how the update says bug fixes! \nLooks like you installed bugs! Deleted. Waste of time.
8279	3	a	It is great app for the phone, only issue I have is the signature; trying to create the signature with a finger. Need import option, and electronic signature. Also once the file is saved all the changes should become permanent, so no one can change them, if it is emailed to someone.
8280	2	a	When you go into the game there a picture of some cards and it covers all the options on starting the game. So you have to kinda click random buttons to figure out what you're doing. Once you figure it out its a good game
8281	4	a	Works well on my Galaxy S5. Looking forward to future developments.
8282	5	a	I really missed red rescue team but the graphics sucked,  then I added this and turned on HQ4X and I got to see the game in the most 3d realistic viewing platform I could possibly get!!!  Thank you for all your hard work and effort
8283	4	a	It worked. The quiz questions along with the explanations help with confirming your understanding of the material. Also great to just have smartphone access. But still buy and read the book;)
8284	4	a	It would get 5 stars if you got more time or easier levles
8285	4	a	There was an option to at least hide/remove the gmail notification, as I have been an avid K9 mail user for yrs. Having that notification icon there doesn't suit me any purpose. And according to other people's reviews, they agree. Not everyone uses the gmail app whether they have a gmail account or not. An option for other email clients would be nice
8286	5	a	Great to check out old crashes! And catch up on motorsport
8287	4	a	Fun game, have passed way too much time winning battles. Just one glitch, I had accumulated loads of gold that got 'lost' after an update. Otherwise 5 stars
8288	4	a	this is the best app to watch free online tv channel worldwide.. but just need to add any option to select our favourite channels. plz add something in it
8289	1	a	Once I launch it, it shows the game title and then a bit of music then crashes. I very much want to play this game and will most definitely give it a 5 star if you can do a quick fix on that. I'm using a RCA model Kernel Android tablet.
8290	3	a	limited ability to navigate more than 3 areas n each room. had to watch walk thrus on probably 4 occasions due to clues not matching puzzle solution. keep trying dev.
8291	4	a	The loading screen after the first race with the CPU takes too long and as long doesn't show you what your doing while creating the Rover I freaking hate that BTW evrything is perfect except for the loading screen on local game play after on the first round/race
8292	2	a	I just download it and keep saying SMTT has stop
8293	3	a	Must improve and update more .We are waiting ...... Boss ,😀
8294	5	a	Interface is a bit clunky and limited but the concept is perfect if you want to learn the counties in a relatively fun challenging way. Recommend over other apps!!!
8295	5	a	You should do live PvP tower quest events or free fun event please
8296	1	a	It only lets you log on once in a while. Have been trying to check my account and keep getting a note ( not internet connection ) but this is not true. Im on the verge of canceling my service.
8297	1	a	Nem sikerült bizt. kapcsolatot létesíteni a szerverrel. Az angol nyelvű verzió még rosszabb.
8298	5	a	"Works fine on my old Pandigital 7\ White Novel eBook reader that's been \""jailbroken\"" to run as a stock Android 2.2 tablet.  Just install and forget."""
8299	3	a	Ok, vidim radi se na aplikaciji, bilo bi lepo kad bi napisli sta je sve sredjeno...
8300	3	a	The good news is that it can voice read just about anything! The bad news is that there's no settings to use alternate text to speech engines. The ugly, kind of a Spartan looking app.... but I am more about function. If there can be alternate voice engines then it would get a 5.
8301	1	a	Stupid Does Not Talk At All.......
8302	2	a	a bit boring. truck flips over way to easy and you need to add a flip the truck back over button. the ad is in the way as well. i like the truck sounds though.
8303	5	a	This could really be dope if we could have the send as an emoji option and NOT the send as a pic. If yall could fix that up then we'll be happy.. dope app tho.

8307	1	a	i dont like how the wolves look, move, and basicly anything they do plus thats not a wolf on the app pictue thats a husky try to make it look better then maybe ill play again i know its hard to make an app but come on!
8308	3	a	Very laggy when aiming.. Hope you fixed that..

8314	5	a	Best ever happiest theme I had ever used must try
8315	5	a	So useful, and the dev was very helpful when I couldn't figure out how to add prices.
8316	5	a	This app is so perfect! Works on My Samsung even it does not support USB HOST out of the box. I paid for usb cable 10 euro and the for the app only 1 euro! Thank you, please keep up the good work.
8317	5	a	It,s a nice app. Good jod guys !
8318	5	a	I can't tell you how many times I've stopped recording entirely trying to resume recording from a paused state. The record button needs to change into the pause button and have the stop button in place of the current pause button. Its killed many shots that would have been perfect. Edit: still not fixed Edit: still not fixed Edit: fixed
8319	5	a	Money that's what i want lot 's of money.
8320	1	a	It won't let my daughter do anything except cut. Uninstalling
8321	4	a	The title says it all. Hands down the best free weather radar app around. UPDATE: I've been using this app for a little over a week now, and after using it, I can't believe I actually paid for MyRadar, this is BY FAR the superior product.
8322	4	a	Wish it had a section to tell if they are online and free chat other than that good app
8323	1	a	Why to much add i cant not play i want to play one after that hi come for advertisment
8324	1	a	If you're pc isn't BT capable and you're  using a Note 8, you might as well not even install this app. I've lept from forum to forum and they all point me in the direction of just buying a drawing tablet to spare me the hassle of trying to get a flawed app such as this to work or even run properly
8325	2	a	It has a limited level of settings you can make. And no option to choose English as a language.
8326	1	a	Cannot open a raw image taken from mobileuncle tools application
8327	5	a	Nice app.made my work easy
8328	5	a	Best keyboard for tablets. Love it
8329	4	a	I like the cheats so I can vist locked places without police. Just one thing I wish you could choose your own guns then choosing from a kit.
8330	5	a	Ellerinize Saglik.Sizin gibi fiyatlari ve indirimleri orjinal bir siteye bu uygulama yakisirdi. Satin alma islemi cok kolay.
8331	5	a	The game is lots of fun and the added achievements are cool! Maybe a few more levels in the future?
8332	5	a	Love it so fun and cute!!!
8333	5	a	It's really a good application. There is no any complain from my side, I am using this app since 5-6 years. I am really satisfied with this app. It is really useful for every one. And please don't be hesitate to make it more better in the future with ne update.
8334	4	a	Looks really nice and works well! A definite must for any mcmyadmin servers. Has almost all functionality except for users and groups, any ideas when that would be implemented? Great job though!
8335	5	a	It olso works on pg3d
8336	3	a	This app is very helpful l l now fully understand some topics which were \nvery hard. its awesome
8337	5	a	I love it and I will rather type on this keyboard theme than type on an apple iPhone keyboard
8338	1	a	You can't play with a galaxy note 5 against an iphone 6. Thats seriously disappointing. You think only iphones want to play againts eachother?!
8339	4	a	" ca le-am epuizat in 13 minute dupa ce am facut update."""
8340	1	a	But hate that I can't download more levels.  Really annoying that it hangs for ages after clicking for the next levels.
8341	3	a	Like !! but dont have the date, very usefull for me. :(
8342	4	a	Good quality game but could do with tasks and earn coins..
8343	3	a	This was the best app ever made, until the last update. I can no longer add \nnotes to a day, I have to add an event. Not everything I need to remember \nhas to be an event with a time associated with it. Also, with the event \ntimes it doesn't understand my crazy 2nd shift and sometimes 3rd shift \ntrades. This app used to be very useful for someone with a schedule like \nmine, but not anymore.
8344	3	a	Love it !But it can be boring!When you decorate the nails it's so pretty. But I don't like how you have to unlock some designs. It's horrible! Plus after a while it can get boring.
8345	5	a	This app is the best it's easier for practice and understand
8346	5	a	performance ottima ! Se so e' a firenze non potrei fare senza , Gli autisti molto professionali
8347	5	a	Can't Wait To See R.Kelly :-)
8348	1	a	We all liked this game. My mom even paid for pet points.  Now they didn't put the pet points and they aren't refunding my moms money. That's just not right \u0026 not friendly!
8349	4	a	It does what it needs to do, no frills. I  like it.
8350	1	a	Come on! Don't download this app it is a fraud! I can't even make a video or anything all it is is videos that are just talk..... it is the worst app in the whole world..... okay maybe not the whole world but that's how bad it is
8351	1	a	This game is really bad because it's songs really bad 😬
8352	3	a	It's very useful! I edited a lot of YouTube videos with it. The only \nproblem is, I still need to pay in order to put music in a 5-minute video. \nPlease do make it free \u0026 just put ads. Thank you!
8353	1	a	Keeps stopping. And how am i supposed to know what bug it is. I aint playing this anymore.
8354	1	a	Does not load and open. Goes from game icon to black screen and back, over, and over again, nothing else. Fix, and maybe people will be able to tell you've got a game in there somewhere. . . UNINSTALLING. ( Samsung galaxy S 111. )
8355	1	a	Not at all with SG Note5.
8356	5	a	My cat doesn't love it but when I play the sounds she sure does come running (shes a jealous lil one). Has options to save as fav or play continuously when you keep finger pressed on that sound. What a great \u0026 fun app. Thank you so much to the creators! Great work ♡
8357	1	a	Don't  get this app please
8358	5	a	Lah sikit aku dah tunggu lama dah :-(
8359	4	a	Thought full version may be a bit more detailed ie. Australia doesn't show Cairns or Townsville for instance. Otherwise impressive, just what I needed. Could do with a search button though.
8360	5	a	Love this. It does its job and allows me to keep track of the money I've saved. Perfect.
8361	4	a	But it cheats like crazy! How many aces are in a deck of cards? Lmfao I just playrd three games in a row where there were 3 jokers. Please fix this.
8362	4	a	Pretty slick, I'm on vacation and it's made it a lot easier when meeting people for the first time in a new city.
8363	3	a	Remarkably free of any instructions. What to make of the Sensors page?
8364	5	a	This is a great game and also please make burn the rope + free
8365	5	a	Its glitchy how to fly first go into your car or bus second press unflip and and nitro boost.
8366	4	a	Good app, but please add password protection from active to bypass stage so as to not to give in to urges to override.
8367	3	a	This game want more cars and cash
8368	4	a	This app is a fairly good study guide for a senior high school Anatomy class. It is a little light for college level
8369	1	a	Odds change every time u press calculate, will rate 5 stars if accuracy gets corrected. evo
8370	4	a	I downloaded this keyboard, and followed the steps mentioned here but I cannot find pashto as language in my list of languages. Can someone help me out. I am using Samsung Galaxy S4. it works only if my default keyboard is turned to liwal...
8371	5	a	I use this for organizing my monthly bills. The ability to mark notes red helps me know which bills I have or have not paid.  It's also great for grocery lists, gift ideas, and just any mental note I would want to keep.  I love it.  Good work!
8372	5	a	This game is the best on the net
8373	4	a	It keeps me calm when i'm bored
8374	1	a	When I start to doodle the nail and when I finish it  again it begin to start and then  I cannot save the nail picture
8375	5	a	This is a super app...had never seen my Defy run so fast n furious :) !! Very happy indeed..atleast I dont regret the for not buying a Galaxy now !! he he
8376	5	a	Smarter Wi-Fi Manager put a stop to unwanted auto-connect behavior with AT\u0026T hotspots, and that one feature alone makes it worth buying.
8377	1	a	CAT WITH BUTTERFLY THE BEST \u003c3 ^.^
8378	1	a	They said that I would be compensated but after submitting the same \ndocument that they asked for 3 times I gave Up. I've been waiting 6 months \nnow.
8379	5	a	It improves knowledge about tools
8380	5	a	I love this game....when i get bored, this keeps me occupied!
8381	4	a	But I would like to see more attacks like big bang attack or special beam cannon
8382	3	a	Needs more update..  Some of the items in the store doesn't work..  It says need store upgrade but Im already done with the upgrades.. Pls fix..
8383	5	a	isso e bom permite assistir reportagens em qualquer luga
8384	4	a	Muy buena la nueva app, aunque aún no permite el pago a instituciones como \nsu versión web. Pd: Las imágenes del play store aún son de la app anterior
8385	5	a	Love the app, but I have some ideas, please add a an option that uses the flashlight to simulate muzzle flash, also let us load a partial cylinder on revolvers for russian roulette. Btw the coach gun volume needs to be increased, and the 1911 shouldn't have the thing below the barrel. Also please add the Luger P08
8386	5	a	Goo app for action - wake up my brain.
8387	5	a	This game is not working Make changes  Put new features
8388	5	a	Best fireworks app I've found so far.  Good job and WILL be getting premium!
8389	2	a	It never save my settings, I always have to restart all over again. Please fix then I will give 5 stars
8390	5	a	Ótimo! Prático, rápido, tinha todas as palavras que procurei e é offline. Muito bom!!
8391	5	a	This is the first game that my husband and I can play together. We both feel like dorks when we realize what the answer is and we hard such a hard time guessing it. We actually talk and laugh through the whole game. Thank you for date night.
8392	5	a	Works perfectly! The only drawbacks are battery consumption and the range of available actions, but they're not that big an issue.
8393	2	a	It keeps on telling me i didn't buy the game
8394	1	a	"I expected something called \lyric maker\"" to help me with song structure. This is just a glorified notepad and a waste of space on my phone. I already have a place to write lyrics down. I don't need this app. Deleted instantly."""

8404	5	a	Awesome .....has all types of status
8405	2	a	"The game was ok until you decided to make a new version. Fixed the start up crash - ok. But it's now imposible to exit the game - only \force stop\""  is an option. Also the statistics page is totally messed up - the graphics there is not ok and you cannot leave the page. In a word - nothing good in the new version."""
8406	4	a	Its easy to play level up and all that jazz. The only complaint i see is u cant sell loot u have to destroy it.
8407	3	a	Impossible to play on 240*320 pixel display because button labels do not fit. Please improve (: New design (v2.2) is much better!
8408	3	a	On Note 4 icons to small. To use. Used to love this game
8409	4	a	Finished the main game on a different device. Please put the english versions of the sequels on the android play store. Can't find them
8410	2	a	I downloaded this app for my mom. She works in an school in shajapur, MP. But while registering for her i found no option for shajapur. The drop doesn't display anything for  Ujjain division. Fix this ASAP. E-attendance is mandatory from 25th sept 2015 and i am not sure how people will be able to do that when app itself is having defects. Developers please fix it.

8413	5	a	Excellent app.   It has helped me as I'm a novice player and learning how to bend notes it has kept me in line
8414	5	a	Excellent game... controls are under control... Upgraded to the full version of this game too...
8415	2	a	New version is awful and buggy...extra menu options that aren't needed and just started over for no reason. Also, ads get stuck right in the middle of the board and you can't get rid of them.
8416	4	a	I will tell after I tried it,  how it's work
8417	5	a	Find the ghost n click it....a nice game when boring XD
8418	5	a	This app works great. I use it a lot when machining and fabricating. It works every time I need it and it's correct the answers are perfect. If you are looking for this type of app get this one
8419	2	a	Its great app by using the default phone caller tryed new one its awsome
8420	2	a	It didn't really do much
8421	1	a	Tried to open more than 12 offers \u0026 only 1 opened on EVO Shift.
8422	4	a	I stopped playing the actual game after a few days and now just collect Zoi every few hours.
8423	5	a	My two year old daughter loves it :-)
8424	4	a	The app itself displays csc and knox status both of which I already know how to look at, but it's convenient to have it in an app. To unvoid your knox warranty you have to repair the leakage on the press board assembly. There's a burned out fuse after you root, that's why it's irreversible unless you take the phone apart.
8425	5	a	This game is amazing! It's easy to learn and great game play, the pace isn't to fast but not slow either. I greatly enjoy this game and would recommend it to everyone that likes zombie games!!!
8426	5	a	Awesome app awesome music totally awesome and pls add bhima theme vaayuputre giridharandhe
8427	1	a	The reviews were good so I downloaded it. It brought up the selected page perfectly. I expanded/opened each paragraph on the page so that it was the whole page. I hit the button to create the pdf and it created a 3 page pdf with all of the opened paragraphs closed. Very disappointing!
8428	2	a	Al meer dan een week krijg ik een foutmelding (er kunnen geen gegevens opgehaald worden...). Ook in mn mail krijg ik geen extra voordeel mailtjes meer.. App dan maar afgooien?
8429	5	a	It gives me the possibility to use an external GPS when I drive my car.
8430	4	a	Рецептите не се добро напишани има пропусти
8431	1	a	paid for this app some time ago and it changed to free with ads. poor ethics
8432	1	a	Took 3 restarts to get both snow shoes. Got as far as making the bullet and fixing the dog when crashed and progress not saved.  Giving up. Please refund.😢
8433	1	a	I can't get any vehicles.this game is RUBBISH no wonder its free.
8434	1	a	I HATE IT SO MUCH, WORST GAME EVER! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

8441	5	a	haracters are awesome! Original and wonderful characters. I wish I had something so cute growing up. No wonder my little twins adore it. They keep asking for this app and I can't really blame them :) The activities are perfect, just that kind of things that interest 3 yo, there are hints when they struggle and applause when they succeed. just what I needed to get some 'hands free' time. will definitely try more apps.
8442	5	a	Really good decision by noida govt.
8443	5	a	This app is just great! The time is 3.19.2014! the settings button won't work! wow! im stuck on level 64939274937388929-483! level 64939274937388929-482 was pretty easy! This game is pure epicness!
8444	3	a	I like it well enough, but I would like it better and would have given it four or five stars if the Bluetooth worked. My phone is paired with my laptop but it refuses to connect. It keep saying that it has failed. I need the Bluetooth to work in order to use the software application because I won't be in places where the Wi-Fi is always available.
8445	5	a	Simple, easy fun, no scam with not enough chips until you buy a full version or any bs like that.
8446	3	a	but not what i wanted ;) Well i need free ebooks and it delivered. I wanted it in a few lazy clicks but.. well.. you get it. STILL! so far its the best option i got
8447	4	a	This is honestly amazing work from the creator. There's only a few bugs here and there and I'd love to see stuff like the spencer Carbine, Krag, Remington 1858 and maybe even a wheel lock. The biggest bug I find is after using it for a few minutes the menu will start to popp up off screen so I have to restart the app, that's all.
8448	3	a	My brother played this I played half I don't really have anything to say
8449	5	a	Got it to match my purple theme.  Looks awesome.
8450	5	a	It is just badass and it does every thing its suppose to do
8451	4	a	I'm looking for sms theme like this

8453	4	a	Only for civil Engineer comment this app.....
8454	3	a	Very bad game don't waste your time \u0026 data

8459	4	a	Have used Simplest Checklist for several months.  Like other users, love the no-frills directness, and also the option of having a task drop to the bottom of the list when you check it off, but not disappear till you purposely delete it .  But:  is there any way to back it up or print it?  I though I'd lost my phone and realized I would be dead in the water without my list.  Tried to figure out how to get it to an sd card but even if I put it in a folder, the folder didn't appear in My Files so I couldn't move it to the SD card.
8460	4	a	works great the clock/ tap clock  short cut is great
8461	5	a	How can i get this theme for go keyboard..?i really like this theme...so cute...
8462	5	a	Alle tastenschlage werden aufgezeichnet? Auch kreditkarteninformationen.
8463	3	a	Updated crashes only. Older version works but it's algorithm is error prone. It does not even try to distinguish between the noise and real heart beat so if you do not precisely operate the camera, it measures frequency of any picture change which is why so many ppl say it measures heart rate of a carpet or similar. To be rewritten, but a nice start.
8464	2	a	Keeps crashing, not saving the panorama photos, stops recording half way through. I portrait mode cuts off the height of the photo, why would I buy it if I can't see what's the result of my capturing.

8470	5	a	This game is lacking in many aspects.  But it is a 3D game if your phone isn't 3D and you think this game sucks its probably because you aren't experiencing the game to its fullest -HTC evo 3D 4G
8471	1	a	I was really looking forward to this app, but everytime I push create video it closes. I deleted it and then got it back and it still does the same thing. If this fixes then I'd probably give 5 stars because it really does look like a cool app.
8472	1	a	It was a BIG disappointment an I could not find out how to change the background. All that moves are sparkles! Sparkles have absolutely no reason to be On a wolf app! When it said live wallpapers I expected so much more than sparkles. I REALLY hope you improve the app and immediately I will be uninstalling it right now. If you FIX it I will install again. (I apologize if I am overreacting and being rude. Just had lots a sugar. :( sad me... DONT GET WASTE OF SPACE! Anyway my hands gettin sore from typeing
8473	5	a	i dont know what is it but this gave me 400 RP in drag racing

8476	2	a	Phone won't install EZ LAUNCHER. Getting error codes. So EZ SWITCH never works right. Should really be a widget in its own right. You really really should make it clear that you HAVE to install EZ LAUNCHER to make it work.
8477	4	a	Very easy to use, and has a simple interface that is very user friendly. The only few things I'd like to be improved are minor nitpickings.. -It sometimes stalls or becomes slow when you have more than 10000 characters. -A folder system would be interesting to have. -A recent documents or reverse action button (or something like that) to help when you accidentally delete something important. Other those desires, it is literally the best writing app available in my oppinion and it is free! I reccomend it.

8482	3	a	Make it so we can turn off the motion control and use our fingers. The motion control sucks. Also why in the hell are the snipers so expensive? Like come on man $12 U.S. Dollars for a bunch of pixels in a mediocre sniping game? F' that
8483	2	a	This new app is no good. I can't add my gift cards, I no longer have my membership barcode that can be scanned at the cinema. It's not easy to navigate either. It takes forever to load and I have to keep selecting my favourite/local cinema. The previous app was better.
8484	1	a	Do not buy this app if you have lollipop 5 and higher I do not recommend to purchase I can't get my money back! I will report them to Google! When you record a video it lags then to top it off when  you want to add a color filter to any video in your gallery it will give you an error message and force close.
8485	1	a	I just wish I could use it lol
8486	4	a	Find the app very useful, the way I have paired things means I can answer calls and texts at work without it interrupting my work flow.  The only thing that could make it better would be if you could make calls from your phone book without havin to mirror the phone first?
8487	4	a	Need to work on arena. I receive error everytime when i tried to play in ARENA mode
8488	1	a	Forgive me if I'm going about it wrong, and it actually will work. But I've done everything I'm supposed to and the widget size compatibility described when installing isn't correct. It only lets me use it with the smallest size of the 3 listed. Please fix and/or elaborate on how to properly use larger sizes. I'd really like to up my rating on what I thought to be a very promising widget. Ty

8492	4	a	It does exactly what it stays in the description. It gives a nice overview of the movie making process using iMovie. For those bashing it, read the description. It doesn't claim to be movie editing software. It says it's a course so relax and enjoy!

8494	1	a	How to start the test  it is nott opening
8495	2	a	This app seems to lose accuracy over time.  I've been using it to keep track of several accounts and the decimal is always off eventually. I've even tried just adding stuff like +$0.07 and the balance doesn't change.   I also was pretty upset on January 1st when I couldn't see any of last years data. I expected more considering I have the paid version. It's not worth the price.
8496	5	a	I am great fan of this kinda art... A perfect app for me...
8497	3	a	I think this app is ok, it would be nice if you would spell out the items \nmentioned...
8498	1	a	Most outdated banking app in Kuwait Period.
8499	5	a	Because this game is freaking me out, when I opened the door I thought it was a blood flappy bird then its just a wall and a regular flappy bird, then I screamed, then boom,burn.YOU guys gotta install this app.
8500	4	a	Nice app. Occasionally find the buttons slightly too small on my phone, and end up touching the one next to the one I intended (or a trailing finger catches one... boom!
8501	5	a	I just spent four hours I'm bricking my device! I'm afraid to use it again. Maybe I should have read what's  new with the app before I downloaded it
8502	4	a	It does what it is meant for. But something happened and it's giving out of memory error every time
8503	2	a	I paid for no ads but there are still ads. Total waste of money.

8507	2	a	I wanted a game I can play with friends. It's a pretty fun game but it won't connect to Facebook so I can challenge my friends. If you could fix that it would be a good game.
8508	5	a	Aku merasa tambah hansome aee :D
8509	2	a	Graphics are decent, comparable to other similar games, but this game lacks the ability to provide clues.  The tasks that are provided via the help button are vague, repetitive, and the dialog from characters in the game are clearly translated from another language.   Would have given it 3 or 4 stars, but gave it 2 because ads pop up in the middle of game play, causing inadvertant tapping on an ad instead of a spot in the game.
8510	5	a	Saving change and this is just what I wanted
8511	5	a	I love it.!😺  1 thing thou it glitches in predator vision .other wise I give u 5 stars!😸Please make a raccoon Sim,penguin sim,and a mouse sim thanks your #1 fan Roxanne

8518	5	a	its fun and good storyline but it is just too short. i dont have any money to buy it :/
8519	1	a	Why is everyone trying to copy one finger death punch?? Seriously its the exact same game exept it has an advanced artstyle and there is only one style and there are only a few moves. Unlike one finger death punch  its not that responsive and it doesnt register taps that quick....                            I would give this atleast 2 stars if you pulled it off nicely...

8526	5	a	Short loading times, great graphics, dodge and parry add heaps to the game. Huge selection of upgrades, but skill is still needed too. Easy to follow tutorials. Blood splashes make the game. Download it now!!! (Normal people do use three exclamation marks to make a point stand out).
8527	5	a	Does what you think and doesn't need to read your contacts to do it!

8550	5	a	Very nice app, love the chromcast feature. Only negative side is that sometimes it just stops itself automatically after few minutes of playing. If the chromecast feature gets fixed, this app in my opinion it's the best of all music app I have on my phone!
8551	5	a	I love these games where you predict where you have to hit in a small, specific area. It helps your maths brain updated while still enjoying the action packed vibe of the game. I found a small bug, of which while playing this game my tablet went dead. I thought I had lost my amazing run and started to rage, and when I went to play again it continued my run but crashed after a second. I did this three times before the game automatically shot the bullet, of which let me continue. Still happy it let me win tho

8553	5	a	I have had this app for over two years and not a day goes by that I don't watch the videos or recieve push notifications. I have never had any issues with this app...EVER!

8567	1	a	Poor development, shots are not accurate to aim and computer scratches and continues turn regardless of losing turn.
8568	2	a	Just started using this app and it keeps crashing. Also wanted to check its terms and policies but got an error message, also same thing when I click on FAQ. I purchased a year subscription and when I checked my profile it says I paid for a year but says my next billing is in a month. So now I'm nervous that Im gonna continue to be billed. WTH?

8576	5	a	Hard to fault this tool.  My original review for this was back in 2012. I disliked the way my new phone handled folders, and ran into serious problems with the base software and Nova who decided not to play well together. And this application just works really well. If you are experiencing similar issues give it a try.
8577	2	a	Thanks to your failing app, an abusive stalker is getting to my voicemail. It's extremely stressful. I don't want to add to that stress by bringing the police into this.
8578	2	a	This is not supported to my RedMi prime2 phone. I need to re-install the app every hour for new messages. because problem is apps was not refreshed automatically.                                             As for ur suggestion - I have activated the Auto Start and re-open the app but still i getting same issue.
8579	5	a	Impressive! Good to see new ideas coming onto the market
8580	5	a	It has riddles that are challenging and that is why I love it.
8581	5	a	Addictive and enjoyable to play. Wold love a sequel.
8582	1	a	Enormous 35mb ram footprint and constant deluge of spam ads. It's beautiful, but not worth the spam attacks. You expect this from Mainland Chinese but not Hong Mingers.
8583	5	a	I love this game , it's amazing and very intriguing
8584	1	a	Level 18 of this game is so close to impossible that it pretty much isn't a game anymore. This game has no advanced algorithms to prevent problems with probability and is simply a luck game.
8585	4	a	I love the app and works great! It lacks support to rotate screen and lacks support for tablets. Very useful to quickly see whats around. It would be great see this available for tablets and be able transmit the info by port 300003 doing BaseStation protocol so I send data to my home ADS-B radar system to get more coverage.
8586	5	a	Love the player info keep it up!
8587	1	a	It turned off my phone
8588	5	a	Best thing is, once video started its not buffer in middle.
8589	2	a	changed the language several times, no luck. shame, as i'm sure the translation is awesome. maybe the next version of GO will get better lang support.

8591	5	a	Easy to use. Great way to track teams or individuals stats. Would be nice to have a way to undo last action. Accidentally pressing a button and can't undo that action.
8592	1	a	"\Sorry an unexpected problem happened \""the game wrote."""
8593	4	a	A good game to pass the time, especially when you only have 5 minutes.  My only real gripe is there are times when base runners should stay on base (e.g. ball hit in front of runner), or take extra bases (advance on fly ball to opposite field) which keep you from scoring runs.
8594	1	a	App would not work. Poor instructions. Uninstalling immediately.
8595	5	a	This is very nice app for prayer lover
8596	1	a	Didnt even bother to play once I saw that you had to buy the rest of the story.
8597	1	a	It's so bad an unpredictable. Just keep on uninstalling and installing. It's just so bad. It needs more updates it's such a waste of time
8598	4	a	Very good color mixturing ..
8599	5	a	I love how simple this app is. All the other ones have way too many options and settings.  This does everything I never need. The only thing I would like is a timer for your break in between sets of rounds.
8600	1	a	You want me to pay for something I can get for free? Deleted!
8601	5	a	Jai hanuman ji ki jai jo
8602	5	a	I love it its the best live wallpaper I ever installed in my mobile
8603	4	a	Very nicely designed. Useful interface with bubble level support when using on uneven terrain or on boat. Would give it a 5 except I can't seem to figure out how to activate the true north vs magnetic option (can't see any difference when toggling between the two in the settings - my location has a 12+ variation, so difference should be obvious)

8605	5	a	About all I remembered about resistors was that they had colours on them. This a great app and helped me with my first project in over 20 years. It doesn't need a reverse lookup because the colors display their numeric value when you select them.
8606	5	a	Sometimes you just want to strangle people for not reading the app description and then complaining and giving it a 1 star rating. This app performed its function without issue on a number of different usb cords/storage devices. It is working perfectly.
8607	5	a	I love it, keep on making diz kind of apps, pple must knw more abt GOD
8608	5	a	I like an update with this game
8609	1	a	Čemu služe vijesti kad ih se ne vidi od reklama
8610	1	a	well what a crappy game, how would you know if there was  key on the ground if you do not use the long winded hint key. I cannot see the point of having long winded hint keys they spoil the game and ruin the game. I cannot see what the game dveloper has to gain by doing this unless it is to pad the game out.
8611	1	a	Just rubbish there was no controls and it shutdown on its own waste of time downloading
8612	5	a	This robo depense game is very entertainment.thank you for this game
8613	1	a	It is so bad game
8614	5	a	Stage 5 and 6 seem to be completely blank just like in construction mode in NES version. There's not even a bird there (thing that nets instant game over if it's destroyed).
8615	1	a	Annoyingly there is no option - it keeps insisting that you to rate the game. And so here it is! Boring.
8616	5	a	This is a great game, my favorite since I downloaded it. One tiny problem though is that my characters will turn completely black sometimes and my lightsaber blades turn gray. If you could fix the issue I will be happy. Please come out with the 2nd kotor to android and apple mobile
8617	5	a	God blessings u forever zakir naik fantastic app wish you all team works
8618	4	a	But the new race feature either has a deliberate mechanic or just a glitch which makes it feel like the circle falls faster after some presses than it does others. This is consistently a problem and it is so bad sometimes that I have struggled to clear level 3! Otherwise a fun addictive game that will be superseded next month by another fun addictive game.
8619	5	a	Like this app,  jazakumullah kair
8620	5	a	My little cousin and I love it. I would recommend this game to anyone.
8621	5	a	Pronunciation and intonations are not difficult if they are introduced systematically.
8622	5	a	Cool to relax with. Easy on your mind.
8623	5	a	Very relaxing game since there's no time limit...it's almost a type of meditation for me :) and I'm VERY happy when I find all 10 differences without a hint :) :)
8624	4	a	More variety of games and music
8625	5	a	Billybobthesquirell is my favorite thing about this page method and Adrianna get on YouTube channel is the night his own words

8627	5	a	Really fast easy to earn coins ..Watch videos for extra coins and I like bonuses at each level. Thanks Having fun!
8628	1	a	Its aalu aalu ka pachu
8629	5	a	Not bad, I like it, it's very kool
8630	5	a	It's a great app. Very helpful.
8631	5	a	i can translate it in tagalog (philippines)
8632	4	a	Love the App! I work on a boat on the Pacific ocean. We sail a lot and I did use it every day!! But it seems that after an update a while ago, I can't update the location with only gps. Only when on land I can update with the use of a-gps. I looked in the app permissions but there is only the option to give permission to network based location. I looked in some other apps permissions and there is the option to give access to purely gps information.
8633	1	a	This is hard to register . they add your points then tell you you can not get what you want for Free. As my card would not register .
8634	2	a	It doesn't give you the options to the answers. It just gives the answer at the bottom.
8635	3	a	Can someone tell me how to get my server panel URL. If they do, I will rate 5 stars.
8636	1	a	I couldn't even play the game. It said everything was in the full version, and the settings stayed on screen even when I tried to turn them off. It's horrible
8637	2	a	Because this app has a serious bug.  The delete button on sms notification doesn't delete messages or some messages.  But that is actually I want this program to do ;delete messages after reading them.  Emailed the developer but no news.  Samsung galaxy s4 mini GT-I9192 android 4.2.2
8638	5	a	Or is a nice game but I was scared with the warning and the phone call one is very horror.
8639	1	a	It always crack! I hate this app
8640	3	a	I think that this app is okay I guess
8641	5	a	So cute love the unicorn
8642	1	a	All it does is just horrible textures on 2d grenades with stock sound.
8643	5	a	Love the colors and the xmas songs \u0026 the back ground pics couldn't be more gorgeous...great job merry xmas to all \u0026  to all a good night time to put this game down ...lol🎅✌🌘
8644	3	a	"Whenever I tilt up or down always says \PASS\"" ugh!!!! So annoying ×_×"""
8645	1	a	Stupid. Plane does a wheelie the whole time.
8646	2	a	Clicking on incident icons on the map has issues. Sometimes nothing pops up. Sometimes the info is too big and moves the screen up, which drops down the clicked icon info
8647	1	a	Hit the record button and nothing happens I've had it for years no it doesn't work at all
8648	1	a	To even play the game you have to pay it's one of them games you get a taste of it but then it cost  £20 to even enjoy yourself
8649	5	a	The Leo King has helped me though some of my darkest moments in the last 2 years. Previous to this, I didn't realise that planetary shifts could play a part in our lives, either causing havoc or providing unique opportunities. This app allows for easy access to daily forecasts relevant to horoscopes as well as other content that has become invaluable. While the Leo King delivers a lot of free content via YouTube, etc, I believe this app supplies the icing for the cake. I just love it!
8650	5	a	So far its a pretty cool game havent run across any bugs yet and gameplay is fairly simple
8651	5	a	All of these people and their boo hoos isnt very peaceful. Good app. Get a \ngrip people. Real reiki needs to be certified as well as... each person \nshould feel when they need to move on as each chakra requires a different \namount of time. We have good flowing chakras which need less time and \nclogged ones at timesthat require more time. If youre not certified in this \nyou dont belong practicing this individually.
8652	4	a	Defiantly needs something in the controls good time killer but not something to play every time your phone is charged
8653	5	a	Great game for young and old. Give it a try. You will be glad you did....
8654	1	a	This game sucks it's way too laggy and unplayable
8655	5	a	try to give more level to trail spd please 🙏
8656	1	a	I think this stopped working with a recent update or version of android. What a shame

8660	1	a	Keeps taking over my phone. Its bloody annoying. Im doing something else on \nmy phone and this stupid app keep popping for no reason without any \nnotifications. Uninstalling it.
8661	5	a	enjoyed it quite a bit
8662	5	a	This game is so fun and I like how you can have chicks and raise them the hunting part is so fun because you have to work for your food this game is awesome .keep up the good work:-D
8663	1	a	was good, now it doesn't even have wallpapers
8664	3	a	Brilliant!!!, but please please please, really need to sort out an option for sorting dates. Maybe a save folder on phone that doesn't get deleted just in case too.
8665	5	a	I just love it. Different types of difficulties. A game which is for a 5 year old kid to 50 year old man. I am too obsessed with this app that I strongly recommend it to my each and every friend. Also the good part of this game is if u doesn't know any word meaning then you can also learn as it contains dictionary too. Thanks to the makers of this app.
8666	2	a	I bought it already when I had window phone wish I can put it on this phone
8667	1	a	Not working on Samsung S9+ The number pad is half missing and Settings is losing the OK button at the bottom. The boxes don't fit the screen area. Pity
8668	1	a	Is this a game or a source to torture users?
8669	5	a	Very useful app and very user friendly and informative. Well done and great. Thumbs up
8670	4	a	I was ok with the default app in my phone. i really liked it's feature that displays multiple pictures at a time by putting them in different frames, changing randomly. Problem is that it can only display 100 images. 5 stars if you can add that option. Loved the reflection feature though.
8671	5	a	When they say it's realistic they mean it. ..its really it is, job well done! Keep it up.
8672	5	a	Great app for keeping mölkky score!
8673	1	a	Game dont work it sucks
8674	5	a	Lo uso da sempre e non mi ha mai deluso!
8675	5	a	I love it so nice
8676	1	a	Don't download and waste Data and Time
8677	5	a	Played the first couple of levels and really enjoyed the game.  Traps are interesting and varied and make for more strategy in boss fights compared with other dungeon crawler games. :-) Nice graphics. Slow/fast game speed option is good. :-)  Suggestions: Add an optional positionable d-pad which rotates with the camera. Make trap colour on mini map different from monsters. More (and larger) dungeon furniture. E.g. pile of boxes, barrels, rocks. Could be searchable; then have fewer items scattered around the floor. Add difficulty levels so the regular monsters require more strategy to get past, and some are worth using one trap on. At the moment, it's hardly worth using traps on anything other than the boss monster.

8681	1	a	Waste of time, I had lodged a complaint regarding filth of drain not picked up and even after around 20 days no update or action taken.
8682	1	a	The 50% of the times I move the app in background it blocks suddenly! (I have background's processes enabled)
8683	5	a	I like this app this app is cool
8684	4	a	Please add more icons thanks
8685	5	a	Tried it on my HTC desire, loved it, so now I got it for my galaxy s3
8686	1	a	On android this app is really lame compared to the iPhone version which has tons of cool features. It looks like Nemo acquired two different language apps and stuck the same name on them. I'm switching back to apple for this app and others like it that suck on android
8687	5	a	Good apps and eagerly want the new version
8688	3	a	It won't show or work for me regardless of if data is turned on or not. The thing is, we just recently got a new Verizon router and it's by NetGear. I'm kinda tech-savvy and wouldn't call myself technically challenged, but still it doesn't work. Does a specific NetGear product have to be bought for this app to work? Is there a catch or something?
8689	5	a	So Nice game Ek var ramso to ramvani j thase Agad tamari I chhamk
8690	2	a	"Contents should be visible on the desktop. . . WITHOUT running the apps; \Quick Note\"" does this."""
8691	2	a	I hoped that this app had Hayday but it doesn't :( the games that the app has... well I don't play them and I don't know anyone that even plays any of them or would even care too.
8692	5	a	Thanx. This is the easiest way to write Malayalam. Change the color of icon. Difficult to find in app drawer
8693	2	a	I try to search for a emoticon and it always shows me a failed message on my phone I would love to use this keyboard again because I absolutely love it but it just not working anymore so I am going to uninstall it now.
8694	2	a	Great app as long as it works. points are not always registered. I check every time to be sure and when its not registering vendors are often clueless what to do. had to insist on getting a code to register the points online. its no fun having to jump through hoops to get what is due sometes the app crashes and logs you out trying to log in again can also be a feat. twice my password wasnt recognized so i had to go through forgotten password procedure amd thst can also be a feat using a mobile
8695	4	a	I like it. It's a great time waster and fun app. I had where I could slow it down some. Can't find now. But oh well

8698	5	a	Thank you.                                It looks like it is picking up CDMA stats even when the selection is off. SCH-I545 (jfltevzw) LRX22C. The new version additional setting is not working either so no ability to switch signal. Do you have link for old version?
8699	3	a	It's the same thing when I asked u about insta house mod I don't see the download so the same thing ok?
8700	4	a	I've had this app for 7months and then the sound stopped working.
8701	5	a	I've only been playing a couple hours and I'm hooked
8702	5	a	Best sudoku app in google play PERIOD. Mega thanks to the makers.
8703	1	a	Unplayable. The game wouldn't even load.
8704	4	a	I love it. The only issue I am having with it is that his has a constant blinking like on the right side of the screen
8705	4	a	Good game for small ones😊
8706	4	a	Simpel overzicht. Gebruik deze app graag en vaak.
8707	2	a	Dislike the way of advertising the ads when I need to check the route in a hurry.
8708	4	a	Excelente app. Só senti falta de poder excluir do histórico alguns registros que estão muito fora da média. Daí ficaria perfeito.
8709	5	a	One of the best apps I have used hands down!! I actually took my time to submit my review thanks y'all.
8710	5	a	Love it so much it's  awesome
8711	4	a	Been using for over a year, excellent app. Would like to see support for travel reimbursements in the Costs section - have emailed dev about this but seems uninterested in adding this tweak. Adding a negative number is all it would take, how hard can it be? Hasn't been updated for 2 years now so not holding my breath.
8712	4	a	Just what I was looking for but with one gripe - the way you choose pictures is silly. You should be able to just select the folder you want to display. Instead it trawls through all the images on your device before letting you choose the folder. I have over 15000 images and it took forever. If you want to change the folder later it has to process the whole lot again. That is stupid and pointless. Come on guys - let us choose the folder first then process the images in it.
8713	1	a	This app is realy bad
8714	1	a	"Se \friza\"" y no permite hacer nada se le da \""restart\"" y sigue en lo mismo. La versión anterior la tuve desde el principio y trabajaba muy bien."""
8715	5	a	Well I loved the game and it's super cute!!! But after reading the other reviews I can see that a lot people from 2014(and not only 2014) commented in this game wanting new characters if you get enough food, but you still have not taken action on the brilliant idea😐I love the game but reivews are left so you can change the game and warn other people, so pls add more characters and even mabie music and a mushroom and rotten apple revive like a green lemon.Pls consider what I'm saying I mean my highscore (54) has to be worth something!!!!!!! Thx for reading.
8716	5	a	I absolutely love this game! You guys have done a fantastic job. I seriously can't stop laughing while playing this game, the animations of the pug crack me up. :)

8720	4	a	I think it's a great app for a clock and wallpaper but I think it could be much more than it is now. I would like to see if they make it more 4 or 5D in the future.
8721	1	a	Waste of time. Graphics suck, Nothing like the Original game.
8722	5	a	Great Unique App! And great idea. Easy and fun to play!
8723	2	a	Pls change the drop down menu color to black and menu as white or silver...this will be really goood...
8724	1	a	Worked a few times on my kitkat 4. X. X gs3 and now crashes almost as soon as it begins analyzing packets. And I can no longer get a refund. Very unhappy. Suggest you avoid this if you have a kitkat device. The other FREE adsb receiver software works flawlessly. So there is no issue with the hardware.

8726	2	a	Fun hack n slash. BUT, the game is lagging on Asus transformer. The left controller sucks. Crystals for practically everything in the game! No good! The adds get in the way of seeing you mana! Horrible place to put an add. They didn't think much when  it came to this game.

8737	2	a	stops after the letter D and wont move forward.

8741	5	a	I can use CrunchyRoll now... I'm guessing this app just looks for all Activities on the device that contain the correct intent-filter then shows that Activity icon. Simple yet incredibly useful.
8742	1	a	All it is shooting flappy I mean did he kill your whole family nice dlc ga!e just nice 😒
8743	1	a	Please put the option of English also.
8744	2	a	There is a tutorial for this app but there are no words, just pictures. This method of instruction can be helpful but I found it very frustrating. After about 20 minutes I created multiple gestures and when I went to go try them, none of them worked
8745	2	a	This app did the test and then gave me only the most basic info possible regarding that test. The tab that indicates results are the results of other users devices with your own no where in sight. This app is not clear at all as to its actual and overall functionality.
8746	5	a	Nice view and gameplay really like it!
8747	4	a	I like it I can use this to show off my sweet line
8748	1	a	I paid for this app a few months ago. Tried to use it today and it's asking to pay again. Wtf?!

8752	3	a	I agree the text and dots are way too small, but right now it's the only app that works properly with my LG Genesis.\tDoesn't work for LG Genisis. I'll keep trying it from time to time because this phone has NO LCD lights.
8753	5	a	Awesome work .Thank you for keeping it ad free .However I would to donate something anyway.
8754	5	a	Great app. I'm  going to download this app only coz of not required any special permission.i  wish u all the best nd like to know if u have more apps .
8755	4	a	Good basic app if all you need to do is easily record BP readings. Finding the right export options was just a bit confusing (it defaults to saving a file on the phone), but not that big of a deal. Ads are reasonably unobtrusive.

8759	1	a	Looked forward to using this clever app,  but it crashes constantly even when closed several times per hour.  Could it have a nougat incompatibility?
8760	5	a	I was very surprised when I first decided to download this game I thought it was just going to be a very easy game. I know my property detail but I was totally wrong now it's pretty much my favorite game and only game that I play great job! So amazing that you don't need to pay for the rest of the animals you just need to watch it I had but the sad thing is that it doesn't save for me anybody else?
8761	2	a	Not as u would have thought it would have been

8768	2	a	The only reason I rarely use this is because it works on the cell network and the online banking page doesn't work unless I'm on wifi. Add a tab to see holds on my account like the website has and it'll make it to my home screen instead of being buried in the apps folder.

8773	5	a	Didn't like it at first but it's gets really addicting and now I can't stop playing it
8774	3	a	The SSH setup is seamless, and logging in is easy peasy. Unfortunately it's \ncurrently useless as a server controller because any network busybox \ncommands are broken in this version: wget, ping, rsync, scp, etc. are all \nbroken and don't work. This means I can't transfer files to or from my \nserver.
8775	2	a	Game progression and play is pretty slow, and repetitive.
8776	5	a	This is probably the best FNaF game. Great job Scott! Although I am having issues with Springtrap. I get him on the other side of the map, but when the video goes out, I immediately find him by my office. Please fix this Scott! Other than that, this game is very creative and great! 👏👐👏👐👏👐👏 😻👻💖 👍

8787	2	a	De nuevo no se ven las ofertas de Lidl. Ni sus imágenes.  No se pone al día  al arrastrar hacia abajo. El app se bloquea cada vez más seguido.     Me parece increible que esto se tome de manera tan personal y se envìe a cada uno de los que han votado una respuesta tan negativa.  Por su puesto que se va a votar negativamente si el app no responde como es debido.  Como ejemplo digo que fui al aldi a comprar las promociones que ponian en la app.....y para mi sorpresa la promociòn estaba prevista para la semana siguiente....fallo del app dijeron alli...  Y encima una hace 25km para ir a comprar tal promociòn....mas el tiempo..etc. Es o no es para votar negativamente???  Cada uno vota lo que uno cree que debe de votar...para eso estamos en un paìs democratico.  Gracias!!
8788	5	a	Great way to wake up in the morning. Really gets my juices flowing! Gotta beat my high score! You'll be asking, how did I do that!?
8789	1	a	" but I rather use it than have this worthless app..fix it and I might reinstall"""
8790	5	a	Buying paid version ASAP!! : )
8791	1	a	USIM AGENT may be a good app but it doesn't come with English words.In my \nLG G5 it is totally a ! BLOATWARE ! app .So LG please make it in English \nwith the Korean language.
8792	5	a	Beautiful UI, Nicely done, loads fast, content is great! Could not be more happy with this app.!!
8793	1	a	Love this app so far. Only issue I have is after I choose a chord,  push the blue button and choose show related scales,  the app crashes. Using a stock galaxy note 4. Updating rating 1/25: contacted developer via their site to inform them of the problem about a week ago.  No reply as of yet. Really crummy that a paid app has what I consider a major feature broken. 2/7 one star until the developer responds and this bug is fixed.
8794	1	a	This app is riddled with spelling errors, bizarre uncomfortable phrasing to some questions, and answer sets that do not match the intent of the question. This has an IQ section, and I find that kind of insulting.
8795	5	a	This is very good app except all font the background colours are light and looking cool.
8796	5	a	This is such a wonderful app!! You get the ability to customize your own count down date IE. Birthday, Anniversary. The graphics are crisp \u0026 it doesn't run down your phones battery super quick (it depends on your selected settings). I easily would recommend this app to others 😍
8797	2	a	Always crashes, have reinstalled it multiple times
8798	1	a	It doesnt open at all. I couldnt find any other way to open it....
8799	1	a	Ie work for home printers as well as office ones
8800	1	a	As stated above..won't even allow you to log in..previous version was way better.. If possible I would have given ½ star only or not a single star
8801	1	a	Wtf did I just download? Does not have wedding theme stickers  just weird and useless... uninstalled
8802	5	a	All in one app I can on or off everything very fast
8803	2	a	This app is waste I have everrrr seen.Yeh dikhata kuch aur hai aur karta \nkuch aur so this us waste.......
8804	5	a	Greet I thik love it
8805	3	a	It ok for awhile and once you max out your 3 abilities the game quickly becomes boring and the link to the sequel of this game shows the item is not found on google play...game needs more to it but as i see the game has not been updated since 2014...have the dev stopped caring about a game that has potential to grow even more bigger???
8806	4	a	Thanks a lot for this keyboard. I'm using go keyboard for English too and totally enjoy it. The issue with Persian go Keyboard is some of the letters don't work as we expect. Like the letter ى. This letter can come in the middle or in the end of the word. The middle one has two dots below it. But we usually don't have them both on the keyboard. Because the middle one works fine in the end too. If this issue is fixed this keyboard is the best Persian keyboard I have ever used.
8807	1	a	Worst game ever, the first boss have infinite health and the trolls have high damage what kind of game is this. The health is like just 100 i easily die. Please fix it .
8808	5	a	Wonderful especially TV1. Classical music at its best. So pleased, never mind the language.
8809	1	a	Downloaded app but not able to create a login or does not able to anything at all...
8810	2	a	Mispronounce z's and call t's  y?! Not good for the learning minds. Uninstalling
8811	4	a	Ar fi bine daca s ar introduce si fazele lunii ca pictograma.
8812	5	a	Really fun game!! Makes me think!!
8813	5	a	It works so well in the dark. I scared my friends while doing it in the dark.😊😄
8814	4	a	It was funny when I couldn't get the love ending for the longest and I kept thinking that there is no love ending until I found the walkthrough. Its so touching and beautiful it almost brought tears to my eyes... almost. The last ending was so unexpected, it caught me by total suprise. The music was greast as well. This app is totally awesome, girlfriend. LOL GTFO!
8815	5	a	I 💘 this 🎮 because it's 😎
8816	3	a	When I downloaded the app,Zoomer never understood but out of that it is ok.
8817	3	a	The game refused to load all the way when launching the app. It would play the music and try to load the logos but it would just go black. So everytime i play i have to launch and then turn my screen off and on again. Don't know why this works but it does. Love the game but its annoying to have to do it every time. Fix it and ill give 5 stars.
8818	5	a	Image quality low, cannot off shutter sound.
8819	2	a	Like the app and use it for years however the widget function is now broken and I can no longer add it to my home screen
8820	5	a	Constantly updating and improving this theme with people suggestions. The Xperia text for home is awesome!
8821	1	a	Gives error on my HTC One M7
8822	5	a	This game is follow the target and play the next level rabbit is very helpful of your mind power increase
8823	3	a	Bug for both part 1 and 2 crashes when opens
8824	1	a	Garbage, terrible interface and useless search
8825	1	a	Leider stürzt die App seit dem neuen Update beim Öffnen ab. Eine Neuinstallation blieb auch ohne Ergebnis.
8826	2	a	Prestalo fungovat skenovanie QR kodu pri potvrdzovani platby
8827	5	a	This teaches me how to pronounce those Swedish words:) thanks it helps a lot!  • Nov. 2015 update- after I updated this, it starts to ask me to purchase and purchase and purchase! Why did you do this 😢 I can't  learn any new word anymore...  It used to be so perfect!
8828	5	a	Love it. Simple to use.
8829	1	a	This app makes playing with a rusty barbed stick fun. I have never wanted to play with my cat by spewing horrible noises at it 1 star thanks losers.
8830	5	a	Narraciones muy lindas y amenas .
8831	4	a	Location almost never works even when it works fine with other apps
8832	1	a	Hate hate hate the upgrade. Can't search movies by cinema and date anymore. \nHave to keep putting my cinema in. This upgrade is not user friendly. Want \nthe old version back.
8833	5	a	One of the better racing games. Well done
8834	5	a	How do you play with other people?
8835	2	a	Every time I hide the pic and vedios I found them in the gallery again with no secure I using Samsung s4
8836	1	a	No me sirvio para nada
8837	3	a	My son isn't even 2 and loves this app but the version I put on my phone has a dog barking over some of the letters and objects showing what they do.  Please get rid of the dog barking.  I assume it's to get them to turn the page but how are they suppose to look at the letter and object and hear what it's telling them when the dog keeps interrupting.  He has to use the app on an old tablet just to be able to hear and see the items.
8838	5	a	This app has completely fixed the notification problems I've been having on my Nexus 4, which is being used as my home automation server. My Nexus 5X, which replaces it as my daily driver, recently got updated to Android 7.0, but Google still hasn't fixed the issue - this app will definitely be going on there too.
8839	1	a	This is bloody crap like y'all crazy ass modafukers
8840	5	a	I am going to get this game I think I will lile it
8841	3	a	In last update, i lost the compas plz fix it  :(
8842	3	a	It keeps crashing but other than that it's great
8843	2	a	No good keeps stopping Uninstalled  it
8844	3	a	Its difficult to save the pictures when I'm done an I have to send it to myself to keep it
8845	5	a	Yes love it help my gloud games run check out my YouTube channel in it will show you how to get it Like in sub in commet
8846	5	a	awesome and i love it..thank u mr.shah 😄
8847	1	a	Why do we have to get the full version to get all the cars? Please fix if you don't I will delete this game, FIX IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!! +abdor hoxeez sry if I spell wrong ur right :D
8848	3	a	Uvítala bych, kdybych si mohla vybrat obchod, od kterého chci vidět leták. Momentálně si mohu najít pouze prodejnu, ale tam se mi neukazuje leták.  Další věc je, že při výpisu aktuálních letáků se mi zobrazí pár obchodů a pak se už střídá pouze kaufland a globus, až donekonečna.  Jinak nápad na aplikaci určitě oceňuji a líbí se mi.
8849	1	a	It's true, I lost my puzzle in the infinite background. So weird. And every level is the same exact puzzle, just harder. Uninstall.
8850	5	a	Very very addictive game it's like real streat fighter but lack of extreme moves.
8851	3	a	It's was working brilliantly but now I can't even open it. Can you do it pelase!
8852	5	a	Love this! everyone is too creeped out to touch my phone \u0026 it doesn't drain my battery. Motorola defy
8853	5	a	It is a fun game to play.  It makes you think and gives you answers that you would never have thought those were the answers.
8854	1	a	Full stop of Bangla language is not working that ruined the whole keyboard.
8855	1	a	I hate all chorrus game \u0026gt;:(
8856	5	a	It like the BEST game ever 100 wreath for that
8857	5	a	Great app used it on both working incidents and exercises and it hasn't let me down. Look forward to the new features.
8858	5	a	Love it it's just an awesome game mind blowed pugh
8859	5	a	Agradavelmente surpreendido com esta nova atualização, faz aquilo que promete, recomendo.
8860	5	a	I love checking the Giveaway of the Day app every day. It doesn't always have something that's right for me, but I've found several really cool free apps with GOTD that I wouldn't have known about otherwise, as well as a some great in-app upgrades for free.                   Edit:  The new interface in this  update is really nice, especially on my tablet.
8861	1	a	Horrible app, freezes all the time, leaches battery and processing power at an unreasonable rate, and that's on top on the never-ending flood of ads. Absolute trash!
8862	4	a	Da game is ok,for me dis is one of my favorite
8863	4	a	I played this game like around 2013. Changed email and bought this yesterday because i really like the pulse mode...but a bit disappointed to see exactly same kinds of enemies from 3 years ago. Is there any chance you'd add new enemies?
8864	1	a	I hate it because it just looks like a mess on my screen! I also hate it because there is items that are not even in my minecraft game! I'm also never going to download it again! Also too big and small! I know I can change the size But its too big and small to change! Note: I'm never going to download this dumb app again! 😠👎
8865	1	a	There are incomplete decks of cards and you can't finish games...
8866	5	a	Never played a game so good but  make more levels
8867	4	a	I don't know how to get stuff after I run out. Otherwise it is great.
8868	5	a	Wipe out .999 tsalap tsalap!!;-)
8869	5	a	Love this wallpaper. Beautiful colors.
8870	5	a	Its too easy to use and no effect on our fons
8871	5	a	Great calculator!  I chose this because of no ads. However, it functions great. Had a little trouble getting to the settings menu, but that was it. Thanks!
8872	3	a	Its kinda scary but the thing is i don't see her/him
8873	3	a	It does what it's supposed to do but with many bugs and difficulties! needs more work! definitely! otherwise I would give higher rating! good luck!
8874	4	a	I would diff recommend it .It's the best
8875	5	a	Love it.. Tells me exactly what I want every time..
8876	5	a	I appreciate the developer for keeping this app free, that too without any ads. It works wonderfully well with Black Player which is my primary music player. But it doesn't properly scrobble music for Rocket Player and JetAudio. Music appears to be scrobbling on the websites but when the song finishes, it doesn't register there. It simply displays the next song being played. I ensure that song is completely played before the next one starts playing. But nothing is registered. Black Player doesn't have this problem.
8877	1	a	Yes it does work. But when I played my first record, it has cracking sounds that ruins everything! And yet, you still need to purchase every effects
8878	1	a	it was horrible the screen was all messt up
8879	1	a	It is fast, but I cannot set image size or anything else. OT-995
8880	2	a	I like the pie chart and color coordination. It would get more stars if it logged through a period of time so I can look back on past days, instead of having to reset it everyday and not having a history.
8881	5	a	After searching so much...atlast found this app. All glories to Lord Jagannath...HARI BOL
8882	1	a	The app crashes just when starting on the go. Total waste of money. I will sue you.
8883	3	a	This game tottaly great but why in the final cars(Skyline R34) i cant use it? I have spent a lot of time to collect money for buy that car..lastly it dissapear when i played it..others,the suspension and engine swap can't be use to..Please fix it and it will be a great drag racing game :)
8884	1	a	Muzete prosim pridat O2 Tenis? Widget by byl taky dobry... Bohuzel ignoruji, moji zadost, takze jdu z *** na *.
8885	5	a	Está e a aplicação q eu procurava  adorei bom trabalho. Cx Angola
8886	5	a	creative simple and painless way to purchase a world class automobile
8887	1	a	This is the most ridiculous thing I've seen in quite some time. The answers make ZERO sense. I (almost) recommend downloading it just to see how absurd it truly is. I don't give many bad reviews but this really just isn't right. It's jaw-dropping, I promise u that much.
8888	1	a	Hints would be nice. Some puzzles are ridiculously difficult.
8889	4	a	I really love these kinds of games.i would have given 5 stars but you only have 2 hints.
8890	5	a	I was able to write sentences while mixing Hebrew \u0026 English. Sending msg in \nHebrew is awesome!
8891	5	a	I only need an app to keep adresses and dates streight it does its job.
8892	5	a	This app is the best
8893	1	a	On Nexus S, zoom is unavailable, and color options are crap.
8894	5	a	Awesome Wallpapers, Love that they added more! *****
8895	4	a	I paid for all of app 1.35 and didn't get it took my money I want my money back.I would have gave 5 stars.
8896	3	a	Well, I guess it's a cool app if you're an artist. Otherwise, no point in getting this just to press the random button until you find something you like.
8897	5	a	It was on point and stuff
8898	2	a	Ne fonctionne plus sous Android 9.
8899	5	a	Just had a quick look it work fine basically the function I used are quick and simple to handle yes sure unlike others say this will work for the video I be working on totally fine well worth having very pleased with this app
8900	3	a	There are a million of ads which prevent the video from starting.
8901	1	a	The game plays slow and jerky ... It constantly bugs you to post on Facebook ... It took about 5 minutes for me to uninstall it ...
8902	1	a	I would not play it bad controls I would give zero stars if possible. Uninstalling
8903	5	a	I'll  share  my phone  with  my friends  who  are  girls .
8904	1	a	"Plays for about 20 seconds then displays \sorry cannot play video\"" message. I can restart and skip past that point for about 20sec. Before getting the error again! Shame good looking content."""
8905	5	a	When I went into the game I thought that I had to move my tablet to go to wire to wire but actually the game just does it for you. You don't rely play it, it is just like watching a really boarding game on you tube that just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
8906	2	a	ძალიან გამიხარდება აპლიკაციას თუ გაანახლებთ, ძალიან ჭედავს და ბევრი ხარვეზი აქვს...
8907	2	a	Sadaele apni bakwas band kar
8908	4	a	Would be better if it stops spinning when you reach the last page but it ispretty neat and works great
8909	5	a	Mobitee is invaluable and makes shot and club selection so much easier with the accurate distances and detailed hole layout available.
8910	5	a	Not sure why other reviewers give this 1 star. If you're capable of reading app descriptions before you install then you'll find this app very useful for clearing up your notification area of useless info. Otherwise take no notice of the people who seem to defy Darwinism and managed to survive long enough to own a smartphone without swallowing it or stick their fingers in electrical sockets. To the developer, keep up the good work.
8911	5	a	I have this game on all my devices ,  BB,  Android, IOS,Playbook and so on and I can tell you that this game can be played online or offline with real players online and CPU players offline.
8912	5	a	I love the app but it constantly has issues loading the data. I have not been able to open the app in a couple days because it cannot load. Otherwise, the daily devotionals are great and uplifting.
8913	1	a	This Game is a waste of time dont get it its so gayyyyyyy and u have to pay \nmoney to play
8914	3	a	Cool... Nice highlight to my sIII
8915	1	a	Muy lenta y a veces no descarga la información de facturas
8916	1	a	The app used to be great but for the last 4 or 5 months now the full app has been replaced with the lite version and when you start it, it says the full app is being updated. The lite version sucks and it's ridiculous it is taking this long to restore the full version.
8917	5	a	I took my SIM card out and was sick of seeing the notification for it. With this app I could turn System UI off. Just what I wanted to do. Thank you
8918	2	a	Im one of those people who have their hands twitch when they try to focus on delicate details. I wanted to learn from this but I cant even move on :/. Awesome for those who have steady hands but crappy for those who don't.
8919	4	a	Program güzel olmuş ama bulmacalar çok zor. Farklı zorluk derecesinde de bulmacalar olsa on numara olurdu.
8920	1	a	Its stupid and terrible. I am usually the pipey girl with video games and always give a nice response. But this was jist terrible. No other way to put it. Too much lagg. Way too much. Plus more stupid junk.
8921	5	a	aplikasi sgt ringan tp stabil
8922	5	a	This product is acceptional,brilliant and mind blowing...Thank you for creating and making it so easy.The only question I have got is that after buying this product if I tend to change my cell phone because if it's damage..will I be able to use premium account with same account on new cellphone or else ,do I have to buy again.Thanks for the reply in advance.
8923	5	a	Don,t loos time. This app not work.it's fake...
8924	5	a	Love it it is so fun to touch the water and how it ripples amazing best wallpaper ever keep up good work! 😊
8925	5	a	Good app. What ever brightness is your lowest . this app will make it dimmer
8926	1	a	This app keeps freezing up on me I'm in the middle of the game it takes me back to the home screen I or worse it will freeze my hole screen where the home button won't nor the power button ..,.this app sucks don't download it !!!\tThis app sucks
8927	5	a	Everything I get a new phone,  I gotta download this
8928	1	a	I would play a boy game than this rubbish !! So bad game and. And bad quality!!😤😤😤😤lucky me I didn't pay for this trash
8929	5	a	Graphics, sound, effects, audio voiceover, \u0026 general feel is excellent. Some things seemed rushed, however. The video shouldn't open in an outside browser but in the game itself, and the multiplication challenge is really insulting. The white pole flying in looks odd. It should move in from the side or maybe from below. I feel the experience would be better with interstitials instead of banner ads. Seems like a last minute rush to finish the game, but they don't significantly distract from the core game.
8930	5	a	that I could find, and this 1 does  everything and then some!  So, it is by far the best!  It is also nice having a Slow Motion button, instead of having to press and hold the Play button!  If I planned on keeping DirecTV, I would absolutely pay the few bucks for the Pro version.  The mini-guide {in-app guide feature} would be great, since you can tell it which channels you wish to display.
8931	5	a	Very good app without ads or obscure permission requests. Happy I've found it.
8932	4	a	Not bad. I can't get the send email bit to work. And it's a pain when you go through the gallery to delete your hundreds of accidently selfies, you need to delete them individually, you can't 'select all'. Apart from that it's OK.
8933	1	a	Why doesn't show your pager number
8934	5	a	Really like the variety of items and varying sizes
8935	2	a	How are you supposed to open the app do your thing doesn't make any sense okay what you told me to do did not work
8936	1	a	Love frozen.....but what do you do
8937	3	a	Very nice but too much.
8938	5	a	What a wonderful simple app. I love it!
8939	5	a	Starting it was hard. It is fast and good.
8940	2	a	Every time you start it a full screen ad seems to appear. Not worth it.
8941	5	a	It's nice application.  Working good.
8942	1	a	Poor image and the lyrics are different from the original
8943	4	a	With waves of cartoon heroes trying to save the princess, the player is tasked in creating traps to keep the princess captured. Like any other Adult Swim game, comedy ensues. Great for strategy and comedy lovers. However, a cloud save will be appreciated.
8944	3	a	Nice but not very nice
8945	3	a	Too simple for a terminal. If there weren't good free alternatives OK, but there are, with some basic essential features.
8946	5	a	This  made  my  true  love
8947	5	a	Once i start the game i cannot put it down an if i do its only to do something an wen ive finished im back on it time flys wen ur havin fun
8948	5	a	I use this with my HP printers at home and at work. It is easy to switch between printers  Edit: 2 years later,  still love it.  Bought a brand new model of HP for my office and the app didn't have the driver for the first 6 months or so but they updated and it works just fine.
8949	1	a	Need help working it and no one seems to answer ur questions when u ask for help..lost money their gain
8950	5	a	I have tried other scrollers, but this one takes the cake. So many options and so affordable (free). Samsung note 10.1
8951	5	a	Goes into detailed steps of how to achieve each braid style.
8952	4	a	I like it but they didn't  have all the animals  unlocked  you had  to watch ads but then they locked the  animals  you had to watched for so you have to buy them.
8953	5	a	Красива і кльово озвучена забавка для наймолодших.
8954	1	a	Not upgrading and freezing up
8955	4	a	Gute App, erfüllt voll seinen Zweck für mich als Abonnent. Zwei Dinge zum \nVerbessern: 1. Nutzungsdaten übermitteln sollte standardmäßig deaktiviert \nsein (Opt-In!) und 2. Eine komfortablere Funktion zum Löschen alter \nAusgaben (nicht nur alles auf einmal).
8956	5	a	This game is so cool that I past out
8957	5	a	Big love will never end. It is the very best farming game ever. Easy yo lay with so many challenges.. top!
8958	1	a	Just bought coins and I failed the level and lost my purchase I'm very disappointed
8959	1	a	This game has lots of bugs and needs fixed!!! When ads pop up and you touch the X or skip ad it automatically starts loading the game!!! Does this in all screens as well .... Causing double taps to switch screens right away when not meaning too!!! Besides this the game is OK my kids love it but the problems I have mentioned at times can be to much and causes me to turn game off and not to mention all runners and good eggs cost money... Why would I spend 25 bucks or more  when game doesn't work properly
8960	3	a	Fun but Ad aggro like you wouldn't believe.
8961	2	a	Way too many ads. Very little context to the material presented.
8962	5	a	fitness program is very nice and useful app....
8963	3	a	Still need more work even some screen gets cut off. Can't visit other farm, problem loading other stall goods, asking to update even it's the latest.
8964	2	a	Who in this insane world has enough time to kill 3000 or more fighter jets on this game??? How do you expect me to do that? I can't even pause the game! I you want give stars fix this game. It's a good game but needs sum new updates to it. Add a pause button and less fighter jets to kill to get a new jet to play with.
8965	1	a	You can not make your planet... you go through human history.
8966	5	a	The best ever game with right physics and easy control graphics and ofcourse the jets are amazing,but some infounavailable like radar object altitude and magnesium flares to avoid missiles hits,overall great but need more missions at different terrains.
8967	5	a	This app is awesome I use it for my daily guitar practise.
8968	1	a	Awesome app last year. This year it does not work. No live audio on Android. Please FIX this.
8969	2	a	I don't like the way this game kicks you out of the racing events and I don't like the way that if you touch the screen wrong then it tells you that if you paid $3 that you can get rid of this.  You guys need to upgrade this game
8970	3	a	With a disabled child my life revolves around doctors.  It would be nice to have a comment section so I could add info important to me along with the contact .  Other than that I like the ap.  It would also be nice to have a download contacts option, either to PDC or other format
8971	2	a	I've had it on multiple devices.  Regardless of the devise, sometimes it works, but most of the time it doesn't. When it DOES work it's great. It's exactly what I'm looking for. Honestly wish the developer would fix whatever is unstable because it truly is a great app if it would consistently function.
8972	4	a	The game will likely bring back lots of nostalgia for players who used to love Little Fighter. For those who never played, this game is absolutely worth a download and a fun Beat 'Em Up in it's own right. The biggest issue is that so much content is restricted. The monetization attempts really hold the game back from being great. Please reconsider an overhaul of the energy and Act unlock mechanics, both for the fun of players and for the success of your game.
8973	5	a	Its a great way to build ideas to input into the sequencing machines, i can send myself mad hacking the patterns to find a fish,its my favourite waste of time
8974	4	a	Great app. 4 stars because i would love to see this add a widget so i can see the status of my server on my home screen instead of opening the app.
8975	1	a	No setting to select language.  Some weird characters
8976	3	a	The gameplay !!!! It is not easy at all to move into the game !!! There are no menu buttons !!!!
8977	1	a	البرنامج ليس في الفورمة .... مضيع تطلب كأس الخليج يعطيك دوري الامارات؟ حتی ⭐ كثيرة عليه.
8978	5	a	I love it, Its realy nice. My oppa was so handsome :** Can you update now for EXO Overdose theme ? Gomawo ^^
8979	1	a	Doesn't appear on my phone and u cant open it shame because i love pandas
8980	4	a	Good work. I can easily block all incoming and outgoing traffic on data and WiFi both, then selectively allowing apps that i need to connect to the cloud Is there such a software developed for Windows 7 also ?
8981	5	a	good app..love dia app, its great!
8982	2	a	Pada dasarnya aplikasi yg cukup bagus utk meningkatkan pengetahuan ttg grammar, tapi sangat disayangkan masih banyak penulisan kata yg salah/keliru. Tolong segera diperbaiki.
8983	4	a	" but no go. Too bad."""
8984	5	a	Este juego me encanta yo I mi tio Guadalupe lerma luna nos engranamos algo maciso en El asta ni dormimos por dias de tan divertido k es lo recomiendo
8985	1	a	It is illegal in several places to use electronic animal calls for hunting. Please add a warning somewhere in the app explaining this to whoever downloads this.
8986	5	a	I like the app it's very good.
8987	2	a	Has no timeline view. It is displaying messages from all selected sources and users and is issuing a notification for it. But this is also the problem. If you do not select all following people it will not notify you about a tweet but there is also no way to see it. You can't select all users if you are following a lot of users.
8988	5	a	Excellent app!! Semoga diberkati Allah.
8989	1	a	I've heard it's a great game so I decided to download but when I opened the app my screen always turned black.
8990	5	a	I had a long time ago but it was good and it still is. ;)
8991	1	a	Waste of time. Please don't download.
8992	1	a	this sux...wouldnt work at all on droid pro
8993	5	a	I even scared myself cuz I just pressed start then.............WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! 😨😨😨😨😨         It scared me out the crap! 😆😄
8994	5	a	Would like to see many more Kannada apps
8995	4	a	The controls not sensitive enough. U cannot go to next stage at 1st press on the virtual buttons. Overall a nice parking game.
8996	5	a	Fantastic!!! Honestly the best app ever
8997	5	a	Very nice Best of for visual painting
8998	5	a	Be warned, this is a highly addictive game.  The setting and music are perfectly relaxing, considering this game will drive you absolutely crazy.  This is the exact kind of game my girlfriend and I like to play during long bus trips.
8999	5	a	Best dic. So ever........no one can gives you so many examples.
9000	5	a	" it would be wonderful! Thanks."""
9001	5	a	It's Bella better than anything I can do.
9002	3	a	Not fond of the new update. Did not used to have to be online to add data. \nSlow to come up and add data.
9003	1	a	Setelah update, gabisa hitung simulasi kredit. Parah
9004	5	a	I love car games and this car game is AMAZING. I have never heard of this game before but now I have heard of it I think I will not unstable this.
9005	5	a	this app is really easy to use i personally used it for my amino fast and easy!!😜
9006	3	a	It would be better if we play against Facebook or tweeter friends would be awesome
9007	3	a	I think it needs to add address and pets that are in the house
9008	5	a	At first I was skeptical, because most of these apps I've gotten in the past were unhelpful. Andrew however, has the most soothing voice  and truly helps me to fall into a deep, relaxed state. I feel so much calmer after a session. This is a truly remarkable application.
9009	1	a	The 16 bus fix! Stop times extremely inaccurate. Do not download. Galaxy S3 verizon and this app never updates correct times anymore, used to be good
9010	2	a	Could not make out the numbers on the cards
9011	1	a	It lets me select the apps that I want to move all at once but I still have to move them myself, wats the point of this app if I dont need it?
9012	5	a	Tolong ditambah fitur mode sleep
9013	4	a	Scenery in the industrial collapse part isn't showing. The collision is still there though, so that's frustrating. If this could be fixed I would like that. I would like that very much.
9014	5	a	Los castigos cada ves peores
9015	3	a	It is an awesome keyboard but missing bangla দাড়ি. Bangla avro don't have (Dari) দাড়ি.
9016	5	a	This quizz is the best ever. I would recommend you to download it. AWESOME.
9017	5	a	I cannot say the best because this is relative but this browser is made by good and inteligent people. And is awesome. This is among few apps that does not bugs you to rate the app. It has everything a browser need without being bloated.Right balance of features and usability. You can tell that the authors are not after publicity and I believe this is a work of love rather than for money. I have not seem them answering the user comments.  Maybe is a good ideea maybe is not.I believe the developers who value and use the user input has better chance yo make great apps versus the ones that do not. Thank you the developer for your great work so far .
9018	4	a	Pls add an option to lock this app.
9019	5	a	Mantap bisa top up kapan aja \u0026 di mana aja..
9020	1	a	Pass code won't take. Errors like everyone else.
9021	3	a	Showing Downloading English (US), but never complete the action, i have tried to resume the downloading but nothing happened. After cancel the downloading, after few hour automatically starts again Downloading English (US). I have removed the language pack, but nothing changed. Plz suggest how to solve the problem.
9022	1	a	It's a cool game and very addictive,  but game keeps freezing and stopping.  It freezes on all the new android phones from the s6-note 7.  They need to fix the bugs and freezing, until then I will uninstall game.
9023	4	a	It's so good I almost tried it but I thought of myself cannot try backflips off of bars
9024	5	a	Tried other apps but this app is the best by far. Thanks finally
9025	5	a	The only thing you need to add is tilt device control is better than this joystick . The next thing is the mission I still looking some more because level 20 I already past it. But every thing is real great and I don't have a problem of ads.
9026	1	a	"I believed them and let it run for months and finally looked (after a \going over limit\"" for the third month in a row) and the app was by far the biggest mobile data user this month.  Awful.  Shame on you FCC."""
9027	4	a	Best for the animals and numbers games. The food section was good though questions came more slowly. Great free resource for integrating Esperanto into daily life in a more useful way than flashcards.
9028	5	a	I just don't like it I love it when somebody you like say like they hate this game. You should have this game it's really good why do I keep saying that this is a silly its like silly I can't even like if I say something if I say something like it said like like why everything is like really silly and I really love this topic because what to tell you five games have fun I have sign that a dolphin have liked find school which is the game that you're talking about right now tablet wont fuction okay then don't listen to me
9029	5	a	before time is a great game I like it its so funny

9032	5	a	Amazing.No age bar,play play \u0026play.
9033	3	a	I have a spot in my screen that is broken. If you could make the game able to rotate to the opposite side as well, it'd be very helpful

9039	3	a	I kann nicht eingeloggen mit Goethe Benutzer!
9040	5	a	I'm completely ADDICTED to this Game!!! Got Awesome background MUSIC!!! Just LOVE Playing!!!
9041	5	a	Beautiful graphics, fun gameplay, the adds pop after you finish a level not during your game. I have this one and the Halloween Game enjoy them both. Worth playing.

9044	1	a	Very disappointed. Group texting does not work. I wish I could give negative stars.
9045	5	a	Unlike other apps like this I have had no problems. Thanks
9046	2	a	It's too easy, virtually impossible to not get three stars, and there are ads between every level, so it's really not worth it...
9047	5	a	I think this wallpaper is relaxing and pretty pic

9049	5	a	This is great application. I love it. You should use this
9050	5	a	Fine work and useful application information
9051	4	a	This app works fine and covers about 90% of daily needs with your accounts and cards, but it still has no such useful feature as copying of payment from existing one.
9052	1	a	This is a horrible radio station app keeps freezing up on the samsung galaxy epic touch
9053	5	a	The controls are too fixed, and you cannot slide your fingers without shooting randomly, there needs to be an update sooner or later, to fix this. because it makes the game too difficult to even move.
9054	1	a	POOP!!!! STRAIT UP BROWN SIZZLING POOP!!!!!!!!
9055	5	a	It is the best app

9057	5	a	I finished this game awhile ago.need more levels.UPDATE please
9058	1	a	doesn't let me plan it just looking at few gardens took me about 40 min to see and i can do that with google images
9059	4	a	The app works perfect for the revision but I cant go back to the previous page wen I click back.it directly close the app.few lines of explanations wud be lovely if possible.
9060	1	a	Not good. Before this I was using another version of picsay pro it was very useful but this one is wastage of time not editing as that one was
9061	4	a	🚫🚫🚫⚠⚠⚠I can't download the files  please fix this soon
9062	5	a	I love it so much in the beginning it was so hard than it begin to go esey.... I want a update for more plz
9063	4	a	Great you can edit and make your own covers and get ideas form other covers you can use for your story's wish there where more covers thank God for this app I love making covers like i never could before thanks wattpad!!! BUT SADLY NOT MANY COVERS but that's forgiven you can use pictures from online soo

9065	4	a	love the game.but wish you add more dwarf planets like sedna varuna and lots more then I will give it 5 stars. please make more dwarf planets.
9066	1	a	Shows 3 blank buttons.  App won't work without data connection - app won't work in many small  towns I've been in. 3 years since the last update, well out of date. Looks like the developer has lost interest :(
9067	5	a	" so where's the other ~50% of the partitions data? Again probably not app related but if anyone reads this I'd love to know."""
9068	4	a	It's a bit of a gem in the play store. Maybe a bit more polish, more in deft control over the units, definitely  sound, some more melee animations and you've got yourself a really great game.
9069	5	a	Bisa ketagihan kyk flappy bird nih
9070	3	a	Liked puzzle concept but it was not easy to see what each object was and it was more luck than judgement when I succeeded. Was disappointed to see game so soon after paying for it. Ended far too soon. I felt slightly cheated. Hopefully sequel will improve on these aspects.
9071	1	a	Crash everywhere.. for real dude, i just re-installed this game and started all from beginning. Nothing changes, this crash is total trash.
9072	5	a	I LOVE THIS IT GOVE U ALOT OF BEATS AND BASS....no touble..😃..DOWNLOAD IT INA START MAKING MUSIC WITH THIS
9073	5	a	Absolutely Amazing! :D This app is a must have for all wallpaper fans! :D Keep increasing the number of wallpapers and characters! Keep it up developer, Love you! :D
9074	5	a	This company has the best LWP's on the market.  They're so breathtaking, beautiful \u0026 super-smooth!!!
9075	1	a	Went into map ingame and could not get back to game no buttons responding for a exit but could still plot a course on map menu and watch the ship move to location this game is not finished.
9076	5	a	Upgrading my review because they've made a lot of improvements to the app and now it's just as good as (if not better than!) the old Rando. Really fun, and a way better filter for obscene photos which is much appreciated!
9077	1	a	Useles. Does not download. Wasted my time and energy
9078	1	a	Doesn't let me set as wallpaper
9079	3	a	The interface is kind of dry and it is hard to look at your phone looking for what cheat u was using. Other than that it works fine
9080	1	a	This used to work great, but now I cannot use any decimals in any calculation - only whole numbers. As soon as this gets fixed, I will adjust rating.
9081	5	a	An excellent brain teaser to pass the time. Use it everyday. It's a little addictive. Don't be fooled by imitators.
9082	1	a	Not centered. Laterns off screen has bleeding effect.
9083	5	a	I use this all the time. Awesome thanks
9084	3	a	I like the theme a lot (truly)  but be warned. If you have to reset your phone, you will have to keep re-buying this app over and over and over. Apparently, this developer has found a way to ignore the fact that you've already paid for it a week ago AND yesterday. Sure, it's only $2.00 but this sort of sneaky and dishonest business practice annoys me very much. I thought I should mention it to other folks so they won't be surprised.
9085	5	a	This is a very good Application to know the Balance of Power left whenever you are Specially Out of your resident / office. P.R.CHAUHAN
9086	2	a	I like the app but I only wanted it on my lock screen, not both. It gives the option to only set it as home screen, but not to only set it as lock screen. I'll be seeking a refund; I don't know if it's a technical issue preventing them from having a lock screen-only option, but one way or another it's not what I wanted and it wasn't clear in the features list. I would assume you should have the same options as when setting a wallpaper normally, but it doesn't.
9087	4	a	I have several medical issues including high blood pressure. This app has help my doctor and myself stay one step ahead of health issues.
9088	5	a	Fishing for the BIG ONES.
9089	2	a	If you want realistic soaring go to Xtreme soaring or Xtreme soaring 3D
9090	5	a	Five Stars for this game. I enjoyed playing, here's a game, that I loved, finally. I just started playing and I can't stop. Thank you!
9091	5	a	This game is totally nostalgic in the best way possible. I really miss RPGs like this. The grinding, random encounters, etc, it reminds me of Dragon Quest and a little bit of Final Fantasy. Theres a good chance that I will get the next two games as well. Download and enjoy old school goodness!
9092	3	a	please fix sound, when sound gets turned on it won't shut off even if I exit game, have to uninstall, Droid Eris
9093	4	a	Nice and useful information for females
9094	5	a	This is the way I always outfit my  icons! I'm spoiled now.

9098	1	a	Ni la probéis, no vale para nada. Falla y se cierra. Hay mejores aplicaciones del tiempo aemet
9099	5	a	I have played many Keno apps and this one is by far the best. The sounds are spot on, sounds just like a live casino. The gifts are generous and I have personally hit 5 out of 5 numbers chosen, THREE times, in ONE sitting! Forget the other games, Keno Keno is all you will ever need to get your gambling groove on!   Updated: I know I've already rated this game, but since then I hit 9 out of 9!! This truly is a remarkable app. Its so EASY to get your credit up quickly! The secret is to bet small (25 cents, Max. Bet) until you get over 30.00 dollars, then slowly raise bet. Also, pick 9 numbers, not 10. Its harder to get 4 spots. Don't pick lesser spots, that doesn't work.   Good luck!  K. C.
9100	5	a	I wish there were more runes and maybe  some different way to play like a different gamemode or something
9101	5	a	I have loved this app from the moment I found it many years ago. I really appreciate my information isn't saved out there in the cloud, even at the risk of forgetting my password and losing access (did that the first time). With the new fingerprint login it's even better! Keep up the good work.
9102	2	a	App stopped responding after 1min
9103	5	a	It's a challenging  but fun game  that's why I chose  it.
9104	1	a	Downloaded this because I was told by the developers of World Chef that I could add friends through this useless app since I do not support the use of Facebook. What a waste of time!
9105	1	a	سخيف جدا وما فيه فايدة
9106	1	a	È praticamente un a truffa.
9107	1	a	not all devices have a menu button (Just pops up multitasking bar)
9108	1	a	This game sucks because u should be able to dress the person up and u can't. So that is y I HATE IT!!!!!😔
9109	1	a	An advertisement app with horrible gameplay
9110	5	a	Game works as advertised. Three control choices, pick the one that works for you (I prefer virtual joystick). The only annoyances are occasional reminders to rate the game and some spelling errors, so deduct half a star for that, but l will round up to 5 stars.
9111	5	a	Its amazing truely its soo cool everyone who finds this add download it yo 😁😂😃😄😅😅😊😀😁
9112	1	a	This is very useless app I must say do not download this AAP. This is such a waste of time
9113	4	a	I have just downloaded it
9114	1	a	" another full screen ad and the loop would continue. Don't waste your time."""
9115	5	a	Even better than the last release. With even more features catering for \nmultiple levels of users.
9116	5	a	Im gonna give this awsome apps a big time 5 star. i jinjja like it. ♥♥♥
9117	4	a	"It's not ideal, but it's the best app I could find for this aim. And also there is some suggestions for you to improve it: 1. Let we choose colors, both for graphs and theme, 2. Add a digital input method for entering goal hours, etc. 3. \Time x day\""'s graph has a problem to zoom(cannot go upward or downward)"""
9118	5	a	Awesome game next level graphics very smooth interface great job guys i love this game
9119	4	a	I like that it has lots of repetition of the same skill using different games.  We like the basketball and clam games so far.  The calligraphy is pretty precise and is sometimes frustrating for my 3 and 4 year olds, but I think is true to writing characters.  It only says a few characters at a time to focus on those.  I took away a star rating because sometimes it freezes up towards the end of a game sometimes.
9120	4	a	I like this app but the videos in the news section will not play! This is \nhighly annoying, please fix
9121	5	a	Excellent app. Great for practice. And very nice sample answers especially the template they use is very easy and good to use.
9122	1	a	it will not let me do anything little bit of the second part f****** sucks
9123	3	a	Cant go in next level fix it up
9124	5	a	One of the few RTS's on the platform and the best one at that. Great 3d graphics but disappointing price for full version. Could h have made lot more money if he made it a standard dollar price
9125	5	a	My sister always play this game and guess what happen to the bullies she beat them
9126	3	a	Demo is super short. Movement is slow and that frickin magnet puzzle omg :O
9127	3	a	It would be better if the full version was maybe $2. I would give it five stars but it's to expensive it's still a good game though.
9128	3	a	Some of my comments aren't being posted.There seems to be a glitch in your system.I would've given this app a 5.But those lil nuisances are bothersome.
9129	3	a	Don't desapoint me I'm a youtuber
9130	4	a	Easy to transfer funds. The password log in doesn't even let you even \nbriefly see what you're typing in. A notification of over draft fees would \nbe nice!!
9131	5	a	Good game. But i bought it back in the day and they changed to in-app purchases so i lost that money. Bad form.

9144	5	a	Not a huge politics guy but loved working my way up as a politician. I did not reach president but it was fun playing the different scenarios and options to win votes.
9145	4	a	This is a great game for those who are bored of playing all those running games. I would have given 5 stars if you could turn off the sound in this game. This basic stuff is absent which is quite odd for a game.

9148	5	a	It really is quite mesmerizing to watch and is really beautiful on my HTC one. I was quite happy with the free version, but have chose to pay as I think this developer is worth it. Well done
9149	3	a	I think you need to make the controls way better
9150	5	a	Love these inspirational quotes that shows what your mindset is.
9151	3	a	Frequent crashes, links often take you to the wrong article.
9152	1	a	Too much lagging and freezing. Challenges stopped working. Uninstalled
9153	5	a	A very addictive game.. superhit!!!! :) :) :) :)
9154	5	a	Probably the best board game on android. It is very hard to learn how to play but once you do it is great!! Highly recommend this.
9155	3	a	I don't like in-app purchase when I pay for an app. I prefer to pay $4 for a full game rather than paying $.99 for a in-app purchase game. Despite that the game is good, fun to play, well developed... It could be a 5 stars but the in-app purchase rest one star. Actualizations with new features or combat scenarios would be nice, becoming kind of boring.
9156	5	a	Great help with seeing if any obstructions are in the path of the satellite
9157	3	a	Great game!!!! Only thing is that when you get to the ten bonus's,after playing for ten days, it puts you back to the beginning again without giving you the five hundred coins!!
9158	5	a	Bought SETCPU a couple months ago. Never able to overclock. Downloaded this on rooted 602 and little D is flying at a full 1300. ROCKS!
9159	5	a	"This is the BEST % calculator out there. The ads are not obtrusive and it's \ncompletely free -- but would actually pay a small fee for it. It has every \npercentage scenario you could possibly need in one app. I\ve been using it \nfor years."""
9160	2	a	I can't figure out how to connect to the server/ PC. I tried including the dots in the ID and password, and tried leaving them out. I allowed Kainy through my firewall, but still no connection.  using version 1.74 on both my phone and PC.
9161	3	a	It won't work on my.Ndroid I have instagram but it won't wotk
9162	3	a	It starts now, but it's being so long without any updates of cameras and versions of the app as well. More than a year. It's not worth the money for premium version. There are apps with free cameras that are more often updated and it costs nothing.
9163	1	a	The graphics in this game was good, but what could have been a good game was spoiled buy a irritating sound track.  Also the bright white flashes was awfully annoying!  The puzzles was given no instructions how to play!  You had to guess what the game wanted you to do!  So you find yourself trying out various solutions until you find the one that the game was programmed with!  There was a surprisingly weak storyline for such a subject of this kind!  Ideas should have been bountiful!  A rather wasted opportunity in my opinion!
9164	3	a	Good game for my kid ☆☆☆

9168	1	a	I didn't  speak anything but pencil is spinning automatically and some sound effects randomly working. So bad don't install it.workng itself so bad worse ;guys if you think i was wrong go into silent room and try dont make any sounds or ask anything but the pencil was rotate itself.
9169	2	a	Bought a pouch of diamonds and didn't receive them I restarted my phone and didn't get them. I emailed customer support 5 TIMES and still nothing. I'm never purchasing from them again. I also play tiny castle and I'm not going to purchase anything for there either for fear of being scammed again .
9170	5	a	Nice app, I like that QNH can auto update from nearby airport. One small \ngripe, I live at 890m asl, the pressure is always around 911hPa so is \npermanently off the dial scale - suggest expanding pressure dial range.
9171	5	a	Install to SD? This app may save my marriage.
9172	5	a	It is my favorite mahjong type puzzle.  It is not afraid to be easy, allows me to be entertained, instead of pressing me for time.
9173	5	a	Fu*k up blast my chest keep it up
9174	4	a	Fun, challenging, with variations of the game so you don't get bored. However the ads make it freeze. You must clear used memory frequently for best results. ★★★★☆

9177	5	a	Love it but they should add agency SUVs and police SUVs and military trucks and also ake them available to us they should ad d some more different agencia and ake their vehicles available to us plus they should add more SUVs for the player sice there are only three🚓 also add vehicles like🚑🚒
9178	1	a	Okay so I open the app and it just takes me straight too the game! Where's the tutorial too show you how too work the game!? And how am I suppose too take care of the baby owls!? Once all of this is fixed 5 stars.
9179	4	a	I really like the roses, only thing is that it should have better stamps to go with it
9180	2	a	Used to work great now when recording wont give options to save or send or anything just stops recording and sits there doesn't freeze just sits there until you exit (losing your recording) or until you tap record again (losing your recording) utterly useless now Samsung galaxy s3
9181	5	a	update terus yah..  nuhuuun
9182	5	a	I too downloaded this app to demonstrate my support for a fellow developer that has gotten fed up with dumb users immediately giving horrible reviews rather than taking the time so send a quick email to the dev asking what is going wrong. Of course they can be bothered to click a simple email link, they just have to ruin a struggling developers livelihood. Hope fully Google will take notice and do something to reform the reviewing process - maybe allowing the developer to respond directly to bad reviews.
9183	1	a	There's a lot of work to do, I'd buy this again to get a functional copy.   EDIT: two years later, no improvement.  EDIT: three years later, still sucks.
9184	2	a	This app works as intended and does a good job. That being said, it requires location information to be accessible in order to work. If you block the app's  access, it will not load properly. I understand that tracking is a big part of marketing, but it is not truly a free product if we need to give out our information to use a completely unrelated function. This is a disappointing move by Netgear. I would personally rather have ads and an option to buy an ad-free version than the tracking of information without user consent (apart from an initial play-store warning). I would appreciate an opt-out, but I know that's never going to happen.
9185	1	a	Good weather in my country pak
9186	1	a	This app doesn't work?!!!  To all users please don't try to download it your just wasting your time...!!!
9187	5	a	Before installing I read the reviews and I thought of not installing. App works 100%.
9188	5	a	سلام. خدافیظ با تشکراز ....
9189	1	a	"Since day 1, this app has never allowed me to log in. EVERY TIME I try it says \SYSTEM UNAVAILABLE\"". I have tried to uninstall and reinstall a couple times and still nothing. What's the point? Worst app ever."""
9190	5	a	Must have app for all conference attendees
9191	2	a	I loved this app and had it on my phone right after it showed up in the Play store. It worked great the first few months and I loved it. Even used the alarm clock feature. Then it started crashing and even after I force stopped it I would turn on my phone and I'd get the error message over to the point I could barely read a text coming through. I was hoping with the new movie coming out the developers would have gotten it fixed by now. Apparently not. grrr
9192	5	a	Love all your GO SMS Themes \u0026 Extras! Thanks! I've been hooked on GO SMS for a LONG time \u0026 can't imagine using any other app! :)
9193	3	a	If I'd just remember I have it. I've gotten so used to editing my site through the browser that I forget about this.  It's too bad they want so much cash for the pro version and this thing hasn't seen updates in 2 years. I'd pay if there was continued development.
9194	1	a	Doesn't let me download this game
9195	5	a	Its a good game i like it
9196	5	a	This is a fantastic effort and a blessing to me. Continue the good work!

9204	5	a	Latest update has addressed some issues I was facing. Now it's working well like old one.
9205	3	a	Read a few stories \u0026 peed myself. Not cos I was scared but cos I steeled myself with 3 beers beforehand. Not very scary for grown-ups. May terrify pre-teen girls (perhaps also the late Michael Jackson). To be fair, I'll give it a 3.
9206	5	a	Loved the graphics though it could be more realistic
9207	2	a	Its not letting the app run. Second time downloading on my phone. Every time I open the app, it keeps closing once they show each fureal pet. Fix it!
9208	5	a	Doesn't need permissions and looks great. Even with the limited themes it is still the best Christmas live wallpaper I've found.
9209	5	a	Great app to catalog your collection and keep track of what you have if you're out and about. The Barcode scanner works wonderfully and made it quick and easy to get all your videos onto your list. You can leave notes and ratings to a movie. I thought it was neat to include a random movie generator if you can't decide what to watch.   I wish it was more visually appealing. It would also benefit if there was a link to rotten tomatoes or another good review site.
9210	5	a	This game is very awesome
9211	5	a	Very nice and power full
9212	1	a	Its nice but it cannot be download
9213	3	a	Good game, nice graph, but the way they display ads just kills it totally. Lost a game several times because of ads... annoying.
9214	1	a	This application is not working . Looks like government type of application . Nobady care about release update and fix bug. Unable to submite complain appliaction getting autoclose
9215	2	a	please bring back old layout that I have used for years
9216	1	a	Does not open please help
9217	1	a	Says it's free, but it's not. Smh
9218	5	a	They should make more games like this its good and a very good driving game it should be made one more part of this game
9219	1	a	Was fun but turned out to loo be a rip off!!! I've tried to buy the $.99 package 4 times now. Money was always taken off my debit card but I've never recieved any of the coins. Please fix or I'm gonna uninstall and spread the word. UUUUGH!!!!
9220	5	a	Very nice documentaries, movies also good
9221	4	a	Nice could be better if you changed the menu button from solid white to brown and tan
9222	1	a	Great fun to play, but scoring CHEATS
9223	5	a	" cuz it feels impossible and too time-consuming to kill a boss that seems immortal all time"""
9224	5	a	I love this card game. The app is really well done, gorgeous and the samurai style adds a cool immersive context. Please, never change the music!
9225	1	a	Adds are understandable but in the middle of the screen??? Seriously!! Can't drive the vehicle come on guys!!
9226	1	a	Wont run on my s3
9227	5	a	Haven't used it for hunting but my dog thinks something is living in my speaker now 10/10
9228	1	a	It cheats you on the scoring , so sad
9229	5	a	I have been using this app for many months and thus  feel qualified to give an appropriate rating. Having not realised any malfunctioning whatsoever I will give it a minimum of 3 stars for good coding. In spite of the fact this product only performs 2 functions I will give it 2 more stars, for more functionality is not necessary (nor wanted); it displays the current date in a 1*1 widget that links to calendar - many of us had no date display so finding one to replace the calendar link is a bonus!
9230	3	a	"I love this game but I hate that sometimes you can tap and tap and tap on an object - especially a small object - that you know is there but the game won't recognize that you're touching the right thing. Also, the game freezes if you run out of time while the \tapping too much\"" warning is counting down."""
9231	4	a	Very fun. Great to play while passing time.
9232	1	a	I've used this on ipad and like it. But it keeps closing on my Samsung phone before I can even select a station.
9233	1	a	Latest update ruined this app, looking for a better one
9234	2	a	This game was fun at first but its just the same thing over and over. There are many stupid rules, one of them is if I'm in a battle and I have 400 troops defending a castle and they have 100 attacking, if I die then all my 400 troops just stop fighting. This is a very stupid rule and I think it needs to change for the game to be fun

9236	5	a	" it really is the business.."""
9237	2	a	Stopped working on all my devices a few months ago. Both the free one and the one I purchased. I'm hoping the developer didn't abandon this! I used it all the time.
9238	3	a	Bring back the original car the new focus is horrible and the new handbrake is very bad never works when you want always work when you don't and for some reason the reverse button makes you go forwards and plz bring back the original map with the hidden town that was so good for drifts ps love the ice cream truck
9239	5	a	It's very helpful and easy way to learn korean hanguel. Seriously  I loved it ❤
9240	4	a	Great puzzles. Only problem I had was placement of settings. Kept hitting \ntrying to do puzzles and it would take me to the menu then start you from \nbeginning of that level.
9241	3	a	Its an ok game gets boring after a few minutes but it passes the time
9242	1	a	Its the worse game l had ever played
9243	4	a	Will give 4 stars until I use it more than an hour or two. Seem OK so far.
9244	3	a	It is a good game
9245	5	a	Muy fácil de usar, muy completa. Recomendaría las actualizaciones en segundo plano a través de WiFi, no al momento de usarla.
9246	4	a	HOW DO I FIX THE LEAKY SINK?? Also, how can I help the lady character get \nenough energy? I get her to sleep ok, but it ends up still showing that she \ndoesn't have enough energy. Also, how do I help her to go to work? PLEASE \nrespond. Thank you.
9247	5	a	I love this game I'll give it A+
9248	3	a	It's an alright app overall, it's just all the adds that pop up make it impossoble to be on the app without accidentally clicking on them.
9249	5	a	I prank my family with this. I really like this app
9250	5	a	This is the game i was looking for ever, it really fun, challenging and educational.. 12/10
9251	3	a	Does not work on Motorola milestone android 2.2
9252	5	a	Interesting game figuring out what an item is by looking at pictures of it and putting the letters together to name it. Even my husband enjoyed it and he usually doesn't like games. Really enjoy it.
9253	4	a	Its a great game for young kids.  It keeps my granddaughter busy.  I love it.
9254	4	a	Good game needs  a  little  more  work
9255	5	a	I love this app .Keep up the good work.
9256	3	a	Requires internet connection to start if not app will force close
9257	5	a	Brilliant. I use it all the time for word I need more definition to.
9258	5	a	Look forward to seeing the things that are right in front of your eyes
9259	1	a	We'll, this application is completely non-functional when over seas, and when I am in the same country, the application fails to let me do half of the things it claims to be able to do.   DO NOT PAY FOR THIS APPLICATION OR A SUBSCRIPTION, IT IS COMPLETELY USELESS.   OH, AND They have yet to push out an update since their  1.1 was released YEARS AGO.

9264	3	a	Not bad talks you what's up wish there was more info though
9265	5	a	I cannot make it past one of the levels, its impossible! But addicting! Justine thing, plz make it a little bit easier!
9266	4	a	So useful I personally like it
9267	1	a	It is so bad game
9268	1	a	If there is some rain it will morebeautiful
9269	1	a	I've been rubbing this word for an hour and nothing has happened and it's getting on my nerves please fix it
9270	1	a	I would place goal but it was never saved so i can't use it. Wastedmy time trying my best to follow instructions but goals could not be saved.  It does not make it easy for user to use.
9271	2	a	Good app. But cannot see cursor while dragging points under my thumb
9272	3	a	This app will not stay connected with LG-G3 my 70d while data is on :_( I found putting my smart phone on airplane mode with the 70 D will connect fine. More testing needed. Update I typed cutting of the data on my phone and it stay connected as soon as I turned it data back on within 2 minutes disconnected from my smart phone. Canon please fix app.
9273	4	a	If its connected with headset .and sound reading the number it will be more efficent .
9274	5	a	This app is really impressive, and it works surprisingly well.  I'd be very interested in learning more about the algorithms behind it.
9275	4	a	This game is incredibly addictive. I only have one suggestion. The reason I never gave this game 5/5 is because there are no boss fights. Please add them, like after every five levels. That would make it more challenging. And increase the limit of the damage powerbars from 4 to maybe 6 or 7. This is a really good game, but it can become a really great game!
9276	5	a	Real scary game and its awesome
9277	5	a	I love the progress I've seen in my child since installing the app. It is educational, fun and progresses to keep the child chsllenged.
9278	5	a	Great app to know about world. I really appreciate it
9279	5	a	The game is great the best 2nd Best game ever the only thing that put it \ndown was not enough monsters so droidhen if you're listening can you do \nthat for me
9280	5	a	Its just a great app to make kids shut up and obey you especially if u were watching a movie in the theater...so TY DEVS :)
9281	1	a	Crashes when trying to load episodes
9282	4	a	It is very good app.
9283	5	a	This game feels like a real zoo! Races and all that. But one thing wrong the adds. They pop up now and then but not like constantly
9284	5	a	It really taxes your brain on the difficult levels.
9285	4	a	I tried to play the game several times but it crashed and I was left with a black screen and my tablet froze. Had to restart tablet to get it responding again. Decided to try again with this game and finally its loaded and plays properly....great game so far
9286	1	a	Wrong! Check the results you get using this and the actual results. Even if it is only some calcs that are wrong then you can't trust it at all.
9287	4	a	Brilliant graphics. Love this game but adverts are annoying!
9288	5	a	Works better than all of the corresponding apps! The start speed is not frustratingly slow
9289	4	a	Tons of amusing features. Variable frame rates for video would be a nice addition.
9290	4	a	I tried others, but like this so far. Wish it didnt have ads, or have them on the bottom maybe after every 4 games? But Gives you different designs to choose from, so u wont get bored with just numbers. Would be better if you can also draw in the numbers, and Gives u different option of key sounds, maybe be able to have a color palate to change background,  and have 3D font as well as the grids. And when you get them all right, sparkles fly around, and a winning sound. Otherwise this is the best so far.
9291	4	a	Very gud app to play
9292	5	a	I just loved playing this game ! it's quite addictive ! The graphics are quite good. The game is classic and simple runs smoothly on my Sony Xperia Z2 running KitKat 4.4.4. Would definitely recommend to buy this game !
9293	1	a	Its not working  saying unfortunately stopped I have samsung galaxy tab 4 lollipop iam gonna turn it of and starting to play in my ps vita you turn my mood bad
9294	1	a	nice app.but it cannot save the video..try to put option how to.save it.. tnx..
9295	5	a	The concept is simple, but you have to be agile if you want to win this pixel block madness of a game!
9296	5	a	These sounds are great. I'm looking forward to Halloween when I can use \nthem.
9297	5	a	I loved this app. It is easy to learn
9298	2	a	This game still needs lot of improvements. I have the key and placed all the leaves properly still the key is not opening the door. Sometimes it is giving me the thread and the music note even after they have been found and used. Please update and make it less buggy.
9299	5	a	I like it so beautiful

9301	5	a	Had a lot of tries with other apps to merge and manage contacts with little success.  Avoided this one because only 3.8 stars but out of desperation tried it.  Is brilliant.  Only have about 900 contacts but worked without a glitch.

9305	5	a	I love this game so far. Awesome story line. Awesome music and sound effects. Awesome artwork and cut scenes. Awesome gameplay. Everything is awesome.
9306	5	a	Ppl r too dumb to realize they need the launcher derp. Dont give bad ratings if your ignorant
9307	1	a	Tilt it to get it to move to letters. Spells out anagrams.
9308	2	a	Stops working,  then starts working, then stops, very annoying I just want to play the game! I love this actual game, wish this worked right because all the other ones suck to. Everyone has been complaining,  but it's not getting fixed?
9309	3	a	I like the game but i keep dieing because there are hardly any animals to hunt and I died 4 times trying to jump over the spikes plz make it smaller
9310	1	a	Doesn't let me clip coupons or show rewards since update.
9311	1	a	Unfortunately doesnt add the language or spellcheck.
9312	1	a	I hate it if i could give it no stars i would it sucks like omg!
9313	5	a	Never thought I'd enjoy smashing bugs like I do with this game lol

9315	5	a	Of app also totem you
9316	5	a	New to site. Time will tell.
9317	4	a	Nice that it takes the pix (for later stitching) automatically - some panorama apps send you to your camera app where you must take the pix manually.  Unfotunately, the app crashes occasionally.
9318	2	a	Won't accept my conference registration number.
9319	5	a	I never bothered with apps until an aquantince a year ago showed me it and it introduced me to apps as a whole. Though the downside is I get bored of those apps fast because of this game. It's music is top notch, the game play smooth, the graphics smoother, the sounds satisfying and it's a challenging game since they added all the new checkpoints. An interesting part too is the strategy. Whole bunch of trick shots you can pull off to hit multiple items with one tap saving you precious balls to use for later
9320	4	a	Peu dendroit.ou je vis mais bon concept
9321	4	a	Quite effective in predicting drop off zone.  The ball scatter is a different story.  However, the advantage is clearly seen.
9322	5	a	Пользуюсь им каждый день уже вторую неделю, пока что все нравится. В дороге постоянно запущены Яндекс карты, фоново работает Антирадар - очень удобно. В общем, если надоело платить гайцам, рекомендую :)
9323	3	a	Let the size be like d android keyboard
9324	5	a	Very easy to learn and short races make for an excellent way to pass some time.
9325	4	a	Okay, I love this app so much: its simple and easy to use. But I just ask for two things. 1: more editing options, such as more filters and be in able to add more pictures and such. Its tiring having to go back ad forth between apps. 2: ADD MORE FONTS. I'm sorry, and I really like the fonts that are already there, but I do Ned more variety. But overall this is a great app.
9326	5	a	Superb. It still loads quickly eventhought my data plan has been throttled. Additional request; can you guys make an option for 'not to store anything on recent' or easy to say, option to goes incognito?
9327	4	a	A very usefull app. I like it!
9328	5	a	This is an excellent source of learning French👍👍👍
9329	5	a	I like to do jazzamataz I do it on my recorda at school and bagpipes
9330	5	a	Best app for cv risk calculator. No problem encountered. Summary recommendation is awesome. This sums up the 85 page pdf file from ACC/AHA.
9331	1	a	"Exact same problem as with the Jack the Ripper game... Can't see the full screen in order to finish the HO games. Even though there's at least 2\ on either side of my screen not being used.

9345	5	a	U anak pelajar sangat berguna
9346	1	a	Horribly unbalanced.  Have to force close to exit.  Equipment choice is nonstrategic, just equip the newest stuff.  Reviews are upped by bots. Notice all the blank reviews? Just bad, horribly bad.
9347	5	a	This is a great app for any uke player. It has a really smooth and fast interface. Makes coming over from guitar to uke really easy
9348	3	a	After you answered one question  it seemed like it would throw an add at you in hopes that you'd accidentally tap it while going to the next question, other than that, it's a great study tool.

9350	5	a	The best  running game ever. no problems
9351	4	a	The pallet and tools are epic but the way it exports pictures is bad. The picture is blurry and very hard to interpret. Note: I use a hudl 2, so if that is the problem then please let me know. Otherwise awesome and this also applies for the PRO version 😁😁😁.
9352	1	a	Retarded. You could make it easier you dickwads
9353	3	a	Curious how it works, so i'll go on before i edit the review.    Update: apparently for specific watches since the indicated buttons done exist on an Armitron analog watch. Curiously, what's a digital watch doing in the tutorial? Trying to get the watch face steady on the screen is a joke! My UTC clock app is quicker with the time display and error differential.
9354	5	a	Excellent app and easy to use. Need to add more fod in the data base but the interface app is great.

9360	2	a	For me time mode does not work.  I have two items set - disable WiFi at 12:00 AM - 8:00 AM and disable Bluetooth 1:00 AM - 8:00 AM.  Checking at 2:00 am WiFi was On.  Bluetooth was off.  Then at 9:00 am bluetooth was still off.  So it did not turn WiFI off at 12:00 am and did not turn bluetooth back on at 8:00 am.  Too bad since this app has some very useful features.
9361	1	a	It keep popping up with Network connection error. Please try again. Now I can't access my contacts, messages and logs.
9362	4	a	Está exelente el juego.. si hay opción de apoyo con gusto. Los controles necesitan cambio o mejora. Consideren un formato como los de retroacan. Felicidades! Seguiré jugando, ojala arreglen los controles.
9363	5	a	Everything in this game is good, love this game... but I think they need to add something like make her swim faster, add some mermaids also I want Ariel mermaid, and also need more actions... she can play or fight with many or all animals...

9378	2	a	Loved this game and have been playing it for years.  However the balance on the kings soldiers is ridiculous.   I shouldn't be afraid throwing three of my guys against one of his.   And in a one on one dispute player seems to lose 70% of the time
9379	1	a	Trial works but pro does not work since update...too bad cause it was a great app!

9396	5	a	Great app,  Love you developer...Make awesome app like this.  people will love your soo much.
9397	1	a	Just now it installed. After seeing this I can give comment. Thanks
9398	1	a	And what is the point anyway? Just connecting the phone via Bluetooth and use a good music player seems like a better option. To this app I'd even prefer the analog line-in.
9399	5	a	Awesome its just like the arcade game. Thumb's up!!!

9403	2	a	Well when I play, it looks like im crouching/ phased into the ground for one. Two, the description says that you can survive by finding weapons, but I can't figure out how to pick up weapons from solders I kill. Three, the pictures for the game make it seem like its multiplayer... IT'S NOT. This game was defiantly a diamond in the rough though...
9404	2	a	Krátky timeout obrazovky, teda žiadny extra a bez upozornenia sa vypne.\tAplikácia používa len štandardný timeout obrazovky, ktorý mám samozrejme nastavený na krátky čas.  Mala by mať vlastný timeout, lebo keď robím viacero platieb tak sa mi stihne vždy zavrieť. Keďže robím firemné platby ktorých je vždy viac, tak je to otravné.  Skúste využívať funkciu na prevenciu vypnutia obrazovky podobne ako to robia videoprehrávače napr. aj Youtube. Robíte to s aplikáciou na iPhone (vlastná skúsenosť) tak prežo to nemáte aj v Androidovej appke???

9410	3	a	It's OK, but first of all it misses most cameras and second of all this free version is very restricted, no options at all. Wrote to the developer about the paid version with some questions, as needed information before buying, never got an answer.
9411	5	a	Thanks guys you makes our life easy when we coming to news uptade
9412	5	a	Been almost a year since an update, this is the first file manager I used with android back in 08/09 and its still the best! Hope you Devs haven't quit. Thanks
9413	1	a	I Can't even open the application.
9414	1	a	You cannot password protect it so anyone with the same remote can take photos on your phone. It would  be far better to use a Bluetooth pairing method, which would both secure the connection and allow the the phone's built-in camera to be used.

9429	3	a	Love the minimal design, love the style. I wish we could save our high scores and view them later. Also it would be totally awesome if the game had a zen mode and more pictures to make.
9430	4	a	I just loaded the Soduku game on my Android phone and love it!

9438	4	a	It's been my fav app for so long but I don't understand why my favourites don't save.  Please help
9439	1	a	Everytime I try to remove it from my files it doesn't have to be authorized to do it what the hell
9440	5	a	By far the best of all writing Apps!!!!!! Highly recommended!!!!!!
9441	1	a	Kept exiting and opening by itself
9442	3	a	I gave this app 2stars because sometime it takes to long to boot up on my phone.Other then that it is a OK app
9443	5	a	I'll just play it first here in app then an actual on my flute...tnx
9444	3	a	This plugin used to work until Android v6 but now as many other users have already stated, it requests root permissions, which are granted, but then it fails to activate reporting that there is no root access.
9445	5	a	My grandma had it and after she died in rlly wanted this game cause I loved \nit so much
9446	5	a	Find the daily push helpful to jog the old noggin, I do!
9447	1	a	It not work. Noth west east south all tell the wrong direction. I buy a \nreal compass better.

9451	5	a	Putting some Indian games on market is appreciable. As people from other countrys should understand the great fun in this games.
9452	4	a	"I like this app as a means for documenting my weight each day. The chart is a nice way to view the fluctuations and the trend line is a neat feature to forecast when I'll reach my goal weight. The suggested weight says I should be 146 which is wrong. I'm 6'1\ and a large build anyway. 175 is a better prediction for my ideal weight. But a great little app overall. Can't beat free."""
9453	5	a	I love this app. I'm happy that you guys had this free sale and I think that you should have more. Some parents aren't able to pay money so this is great. Please fix the bug in the blue house with the children's shelf. I can take stuff off of it but I can't put it back on.
9454	5	a	love this one but don't  know how to draw animals
9455	2	a	This is junk because this game closed while playing and restart on 1 lvl
9456	4	a	If i was lost somewhere i could learn this and make  my butt on fire
9457	5	a	ONLY THINK IT SHOULD BE FREE BUT ITS REALLY GOOD.
9458	4	a	Thanks for fixing the force close.

9463	5	a	Wonderful I love free games!!!
9464	4	a	I love this app. I have used it in the past to help get pregnant. I wish an \nIUD was an option to choose from in the contraceptive section in the \nsettings.
9465	5	a	Nice game but too many ads
9466	1	a	Warns about speed cameras in the other direction, and a lot of cameras is \nmissing. Speedlimits are pretty accurate, and that it's possible to choose \nyour own threshold for when it shall warn you is good. But when it's not \npossible to turn off all the inaccurate speedcamera warnings, it's not \nuseful.
9467	1	a	With update to your present version I have not been able to retrieve my over one year's previous data. The data is all lost so there is no incentive to upgrade to your premium version.
9468	5	a	Not immediately intuitive. But worth reading the help: this really is very clever.
9469	4	a	Very good but still lacks many words, mainly in Brazilian Portuguese
9470	3	a	..since Sound Off doesn't actually work, I can't use this in the locations I want to where I need it to be quiet. You need two menu options: Sound Effects Off, and Music Off. And they both need to work!
9471	4	a	This game is really good. I do have one recommendation tho; I kind of want four character slots instead of two I don't want to choose between four characters. I'd rather just have one of each.
9472	2	a	Very simple and easy to learn. Can get old quicker than other games that have more bells and whisles.  It has a decent physics engine so I say its worth a try. Just don't be supprised when a week from downloadong app, you are uninstalling.
9473	1	a	App is no good locked on one subject will not change. I will now go to \nshoprite new app is very hard to find the categories you need
9474	5	a	I liked the old version where the hearts were falling like rain
9475	4	a	Very helpfull quick n easy
9476	5	a	This app is fantastic to manage your day to day tasks. You should also try as well.
9477	2	a	It doesnt work fine in Oreo. It shows 2 sd cards. I just have 1, and the write speed is 0.
9478	5	a	still dont have the code
9479	5	a	Unlike some others I've tried, this word search allows you the option to \nselect words from either end \u0026 has multiple overlaying words. It allows you \nto change word selection method, difficulty level, size \u0026 if timed. You can \nuse light or dark themes and multi-colored or gray highlights. The types of \nwords are varied \u0026 not repetitive from one game to the next. It uses a \nbroader vocabulary than some others I've tried. I like the dictionary \nw/links to look up words I don't know \u0026 increase my vocabulary.
9480	5	a	As I am writing this review, my 4 month old soon is sleeping peacefully next to me in the car waiting for mom.  Currently listening to the radio white noise - seems to work for my son.  This is perhaps the most useful app i've installed from the Android market.
9481	1	a	I don't need this game because my cat already comes to me 😸😸😸😸😹
9482	4	a	Wish i could change info on current counters
9483	5	a	I have tried several apps. But this app is simple and effective. No ads. Locks apps and hides pictures and videos. Great work.
9484	1	a	There is one song that you can play
9485	5	a	This is a great add-on to your device:)

9493	4	a	I love this game It's so cool but give us a little bit more time in lvls
9494	5	a	My kids love this game it's so educational
9495	5	a	The perfect game for when you want to get away for a little bit but not too long. I can be sick of it in about 20 minutes but then craving it again in less than an hour
9496	2	a	It's stop at the last message i send never let me change message evin if i reinstall again
9497	3	a	It needs better WIC it needs battle what it needs Better Boy
9498	1	a	This is a stupid game . I really don't like it.
9499	2	a	I have installed this app, but to register I am not getting activation code on my mobile number.
9500	4	a	I wish I could set it on my lock screen.
9501	5	a	Nice app,United rajput samaj keep it up
9502	1	a	Lame no fun or online
9503	4	a	Good for cropping my photos so that I can upload them to fb without awful background
9504	1	a	It doesn't open..I can't imagine wasting ma data like this
9505	1	a	Esa putada no bloque nadaaaa
9506	1	a	3 mods r pathetic. Worst mods Ive ever seen. They argue n add to the drama rather than stay above it and fix it. Deleting. Dont waste your time.
9507	1	a	Said it was finished downloading, never did. Wouldn't suggest this app to anyone.
9508	5	a	Vocabulary learning  is a good way to learn English . English to bangla vocabulary is useful for Bengali people and school going kids like grade two or three.

9510	3	a	Better if graphics will little more good.... Please update the version...thank you
9511	5	a	One of the things I like is that it look like your reading a comic book
9512	2	a	Since the update the pop up ads are to many , to often! Going to delete it and find anither app.
9513	1	a	I bet the game over 4 X'S B4 I realized tht I wasn't progressing... Just playing the same levels ova \u0026 ova... Uninstalling.. Would b a great game if it was more competitive \u0026 definitely more levels !!! Fix and I'll give more stars...
9514	5	a	This app does an outstanding job. It can take a 44mb file and turn it into \na 4mb file with very little loss of video quality. You can take a 1-minute \nvideo and downsize it to send in text messaging, and not be stuck with the \nterrible compression offered by the text messaging apps. Easy to use.
9515	5	a	Yes exactly looking forward for this app thank you so much
9516	4	a	Microban level 9 seems unsolvable!
9517	2	a	Not good aap....I don't like it😠

9524	5	a	Love it,and thank you guys!
9525	5	a	I love this game. But it could use some updates. I feel like this game \ncould be a really popular game if it just got out there with ads or \nsomething. Update it to would be great.
9526	1	a	This game is so frustrating I'll get in and the second I start playing the game logs me out.😡😠😤😧
9527	5	a	Itz the best app that I've had for what I use it for period
9528	5	a	Crashing has been fixed I think with the latest update. Will edit review if anything changes. Thanks for the fix! Pixel 1 XL. Working great as of 11/19/2018! Ty dev!

9542	1	a	Worthless app would not let me sign up. It just stayed on sign up screen. \nVery disappointed.
9543	2	a	I think it would be a nice game if u had options \u0026 u were able to save the best level or u should be able to use a life or something for touching a bee or something
9544	1	a	I installed it but then couldn't find it anywhere on my phone. Unusable bloatware at this point.
9545	4	a	I usually use this app when travelling and it's a great time-killer while learning to answer test questions fast. It doesn't teach anything, but simply test your knowledge and shows you your weak points which is already something. どうもありがとう。
9546	5	a	I like this game sike ITs a peace of crap
9547	2	a	Use to love it. Now I have have an S8and the floating locket image will not work. I'm sad.
9548	5	a	It's app is too good
9549	3	a	Nice little sequencer with decent options, but it performed poorly on my device (Samsung Galaxy A8). There was stuttering and clipping in the output whenever I used more than 2 or 3 different pads in a loop.
9550	4	a	Very good.  I liked it! Ty.
9551	2	a	This could be a really great game! But the pop up ads are rediculous!! I can understand an ad here and there but they are out of control. You can't even enjoy the game. It's a shame really...
9552	5	a	This app is addictive. It's the perfect format,  if it could be more comprehensive then go for it.
9553	2	a	When I used the check in feature I sat and waited while people who checked in after I arrived were served before me. It didn't save any time nor make my experience any different. Walking in or using the app, only difference is longer wait and more effort.
9554	4	a	Very well hidden objects. I like it a lot , so far (just on  level 2)
9555	5	a	Yass perfect for android lovers 🙌

9562	5	a	Love the theme. Any way you could do dolphin mini, droid x and android forums icons then my main screen would be complete
9563	2	a	Sadly this game doesn't work on my LG G3. All I get is a black screen.
9564	5	a	It is a very creative thinking of such planes that can fly high and smooth. There are many designs of planes as well as other things. I liked this app very much!!!
9565	1	a	Looks cool but I have no clue what's going on.
9566	5	a	Finally, I found a way to use my 2 spare smart tags through this nifty app. Good thing that those smart tags are writable. Thanks!

Long audio cuts into music, especially annoying on blue tooth headsets, but otherwise best app as far as customizing reps, sets, rest, prep.*update* still using and still feel the same. Stillglitches and minor annoyances with the curs, but best out there.
9572	3	a	Wish I could share it on my Instagram page
9573	5	a	This is the best app for learning how to conjugate your verbs..  It is perfect
9574	3	a	I optimistically backed this app back when it was in Kickstarter. It's good and simple. Does exactly what it says while being stable. The problem is it is missing features still that were promised back then, almost 5 years ago. I would rate it higher if after backing it and years of subscription the development would have finished out, but, alas it has stagnated.
9575	5	a	Took security+ sy0-501 today and passed with a 784. Used this app for practice tests, watched all of professor messers videos, and did performance based questions on the Gibson website. This app definitely helped me out!
9576	5	a	Call me a bonehead, but sometimes these games are so hard I have to just use the hint button to get through it. But this is just tricky enough to be interesting and you can move around figuring out the next move yourself.
9577	3	a	Lose napravljena aplikacija.. Ne svidja mi se način rada i otvaranje..
9578	3	a	I like playing the game, but the cost of items is just insulting.  $10-$25 to play dress up and give double jump?
9579	5	a	Удобно следит за состоянием счета и сразу платить картой. Работает четко!
9580	5	a	I love it, it let's you add emojis I love it AMAZING 💞
9581	1	a	This game is dumb you can't see anything your doing and it force stops itself every time. Fix the bugs and I might rate higher.
9582	1	a	It won't even let me in the stupid app
9583	5	a	It's a really good game I like it a lot
9584	5	a	If you're looking for an industry standard, feature rich synthesizer that takes you by the hand then you'll be disappointed. Instead what you get is an impeccably designed and easy to use model that has everything you could possibly want if you are just getting started with synthesizers. It encourages experimentation and allows you to get your head round the basics of synth programming. It'd be nice to see effects such as delay or distortion added at some point, but other than that I have no complaints at all. For an accessible and well equipped synthesizer for beginners or people that just want to play around with sounds a bit, you'd be a fool to look anywhere else.
9585	1	a	Its wastage of time and net
9586	5	a	I luv ur wallpapers! So many choices! U can make it ur way, so many choices. Fortunately I do not have any issues. Keep them coming!
9587	5	a	I really enjoy this app
9588	3	a	Just wanted to let the dev know that the game lost sound when i closed an \nadd in the midle of it,and i guess you will also want to make it that the \nuser can not close the add until it finished.
9589	5	a	I really like it i can't put any other app in it's category bcz it's so amazing app I'm impressed
9590	1	a	All the time it shows error.
9591	5	a	Why should all these investing games need wifi I just downloaded a game eternium it need also wifi l hate it
9592	5	a	I know the developer he is the best ever.
9593	1	a	Impossible to add numbers on previous days.
9594	5	a	"father's day is coming soon. I am all prepared with \Father's day quotes\"""""
9595	5	a	It's simple. It has memes,therefore I play
9596	5	a	Well made app and now it got even better with the hardware decoder support for the HD channels.
9597	5	a	Its a very nice app to listen and download the holy Quran but you must need an internet connection. They are the best reciters around the earth.
9598	5	a	Does what it says. Nice Work. Thanks for this nice tool.
9599	4	a	Doet wat het moet doen, maar nog wel wat extra functies toe te voegen...
9600	5	a	Wow you got awesome apps cool samueljh1 I gave you five stars
9601	4	a	Many explanations with various kinds of dictionaries so easy to understand but it sometimes exits unwillingly.however it is still preferable.
9602	5	a	It is the excellent 2019 calendar app.
9603	5	a	As I said best game it's great I can't stop playing .darkness graphic  is good
9604	5	a	This is one of my most favorite apps of all time. Very addictive when you try and earn achievements and unlock units. As for ads they even have a code you can find to turn them off! The retro game graphics are superb and there really aren't any problems with the app except that the music is a little low quality on my device but that's it. Definitely a must have app and was even mentioned on Vsauce3. Download now! But one more problem is my Champions just seem to disappear when they reach the end of a lane
9605	5	a	I use this app to grab SWF files for my phone,never failed me since! And for the low raters,make sure to tinker with some of the settings,i had to do this in order for me to get what I wanted
9606	1	a	What is this I don't know how to play, my record was 345 taps then I uninstalled this
9607	5	a	La la la love this game. So does my 4yr old niece. She loves the theme music at the main menu too bad theres no way to download it
9608	4	a	I love it already! I'm completely taken in. I just started to. Just finished and I can't wait to play the next one!
9609	2	a	Started over twice, I would do the puzzle for 2nd snowshoe, but it wouldn't give it to me.
9610	5	a	It is nice. my sister likes it, she just let me comment for her because she doesn't have an account here on google play, but she says that rate it 5 stars because it is very fun and she goes coco nuts for it. keep going Libii!
9611	1	a	Game is too easy even on the hardest level.
9612	5	a	Before Wat hing can't give Rate
9613	5	a	I enjoyed it greatly and loved the endings. I also lived the way you fitted music correctly to fit the mood in the entire game. I dont know if you have more games but if you do I'm so  going to play it!
9614	3	a	I got bored within an hour and made it to lvl 37 in that time, and gave up on 37
9615	3	a	It could convert a file to mp3, but the file doesn't appear on the media player list, just on the file manager. Any help please?
9616	4	a	very helpful app truly simple to use,  especially when the component is burnt out or missing. thank you.
9617	1	a	Me and my friend we're making a funny commercial and as soon as we finished it said it has stopped while we we're watching what we spent a good amount of our time on.  So I don't recommend this app if you have any Samsung.
9618	3	a	I'd give it a much higher score if you could simply draw on the photos.  Seems like a simple request and would certainly be part.
9619	1	a	App constantly crashes as soon as I open it. This has only started since most recent update. I have uninstalled and reinstalled still doesn't work
9620	1	a	"Terrible graphic on my Note 10\ . It is not HD"""
9621	3	a	Game is nice but pls provide multiplayer online game
9622	3	a	I give it three stars nothin really to do but go up and down  really people no the  best bike game i played but for past time
9623	5	a	Very good app for my phone.
9624	5	a	Cutest thing ever! Just one thing can you fix it so my phone won't go to sleep while I use this app? I know I can turn sleep mode off in settings but it would be so much easier if I didn't have to go back and forth when I play it.
9625	1	a	I sent 2 reports it's not opening keeps crashing
9626	5	a	Thanku devs for this app...its a lotta help while circuiting
9627	5	a	more truck and more level
9628	1	a	Very glitchy, poorly designed and much better options exist.
9629	1	a	This is nothing compared  to forI phone apps. So disappointing. Android has no good apps got auto tune. Songify is the best! This is bad quality.
9630	1	a	This is so stupid when i launch my launchers its STILLL ON THE DEFAULT HOME!!! FIX IT .. OR I REPORT THIS APP!!!!!
9631	4	a	I played all candy games but all are locked plz fix this
9632	5	a	But please add a free mode for all the helicopters
9633	1	a	Have contacted GO 3 times with no response.  The paid widget does not remove ads (theme ads).  I'm not sure why Google permits this but you should not buy the premium version if you are trying to get rid of ads.    Its such a simple change I could probably program it myself.  Why GO, why do you hate your customers?
9634	1	a	DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME👹👹👹
9635	2	a	Bad audio. Very muffled. Singing is even worse!
9636	1	a	Dont download this app Totally waste
9637	2	a	Looks like it would be a great game, unfortunately it freezes my phone requiring a battery pull.
9638	1	a	Just keeps calling googles speech recognizer intent over and over, not true continuous dictation
9639	1	a	This app is tooooooo bad I recharge 25 usd but not credit in my account this app is totally fake

9641	1	a	Can't open anything on my Nexus. Says sorry recipe in unable to open. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Same thing too bad.
9642	3	a	1. Cannot be moved to SD card. 2. Even a basic dark theme needs to be downloaded! 3. Not that customizable.
9643	4	a	Good to know the status
9644	5	a	Surprisingly, this is an awesome live \u0026 interactive wallpaper app! Lol... I say surprisingly because most developers shouldn't even categorize their wallpapers as live  because most of them don't do anything, they're just photos. This one is genuinely live \u0026 you can actually make things move, therefore it's really interactive! Question: what's the difference between the seasons? When I set any of them nothing changes, not even the scene outside the windows. What's supposed to happen with each chosen season?
9645	5	a	Best app in the world
9646	4	a	Well. It seems okey but the  voice quality is not that good, I wonder if it is because of my connection speed.
9647	1	a	did not let me in please don't install
9648	5	a	The truck blows up because you have to hold the clutch up and gas down and if you go past the danger meter with the red part it blows up. See I now more about cars without my dad he left me at eight. Learn something or stuff. Instead of games.and I'm 14 now.
9649	5	a	I luv this app! It easily loads, it is easier to use because you can search for your song or artist and you can share your new tone. Plus it shows the frequencies so you can be accurate in cutting the piece of music. I have a new tone for each week! And each person, depending on how i feel about them \u003cevil grin\u003e Cmon, go ahead, install it. You wont be dissapointed :)
9650	3	a	The AI is too easy to beat and it is hard to see what happened last, as this is apparently a Hobby project though.. Thanks
9651	4	a	Omg like all my go I love this game
9652	4	a	I can't log in to my account. I forgot the password and when I reset it through email. I don't get any emails. please help me. I love this app so much I need your use it. Thanks!
9653	5	a	Dr lagu yang edukatif dn tepat sesuai umur, anak dpt berkembang dengan baik.
9654	5	a	Very good it always worked fine
9655	5	a	Ahh isn't it just nice to play all the 64 games you never had are could afford well now I can with this lovely app. Also playing Mario 64 brings back memories
9656	1	a	The worst ever game I played..  No movement of the player circle around the clock ticking
9657	3	a	It says 600 coins to go to the next level.  I had just under 650 coins and it put me in negative by around 120. Good fun app, but don't pay for coins
9658	4	a	If you love baseball then this app provides updated info both past and present stats and games played.
9659	5	a	Yep, still loving the app and the station!     App works great. Stream from anywhere! Love the station, have been listening to it since the beginning.
9660	3	a	Fix  the ball glitch, button glitch, and the character glitch (when they fly out or get stuck in the goal, ground, etc) and pls fix blue teams kicking abilities  it will make the game better. Like if you agree.
9661	5	a	Omo! I have my new favorite app! Wait! I have 2 favorite App.   KD Collage and This App. Gosh! Why haven't I discover this App before.    Still! I LOVE IT! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO DOWNLOAD!  [To: KDN Soft]  Thank You So Much for creating such an awesome Apps.   I really love your 2 Apps. Please make more awesome Apps.   And DON'T CHANGE IT PLEASE!  Thanks A LOT.
9662	1	a	Tengo otras ctas. Declaradas en intermatico como las de servicio celular y no las puede abrir para realizar el pago, tampoco existe la opción para declarar ctas. Eso no puede faltar considerando su portabilidad que no debe fallar.
9663	1	a	I tried to play it but its says its not responding
9664	5	a	Simple and nice interface. Contains corresponding references to the driving manual for each question. Finally, it contains almost all the questions in the actual test. Good one. I passed on my first attempt.
9665	4	a	PROBLEM: individual item edit shuts down whole app when adding new! Plus re edit icon gone after entry. Please Fix! Otherwise, I love it! Being able to create more than one simple list is great for my multiple clients!
9666	5	a	I love it this application. Marry Chrismas and Happy New Year
9667	4	a	@ N'Tanya the struggle is real. Lol i keep finding with all these drum machine apps you cant program the kits to your own specs. ^^BATMAN^^
9668	4	a	I did enjoy the game. Had to restart several times as there is one bedroom that can only be entered once and failed to obtain a necessary item I needed. The clues could have been a little more clear. Certainly far from the worst game I played...I love games of this genre.
9669	4	a	Its fun.. only to many ads
9670	5	a	It wasn't there before. However I compared the text to an online database and it's ESV. Great search app.
9671	4	a	I enjoy this game but it doesn't always work. Sometimes it just spins for a really long time and tells me the machine is currently unavailable. It gets annoying. But overall, not a bad game at all
9672	5	a	Puts my son right to sleep \u0026 myself as well
9673	1	a	So boring if u like stupid boring and ads for dayz games then u should get this game
9674	1	a	So the one main use of this app is its GPS locator, which tried to convince \nme it had received a signal accurate to six metres, six seconds ago, while \nI was at a location two full houses away from there. This is dangerously \nmisleading and bad coding considering the actual embedded Google map was \nshowing my correct location but your app's terrible API was completely \nfailing to translate it into an accurate reading.
9675	1	a	Useless app. Really tells you nothing in real time.
9676	5	a	Its beautiful to open and close ending .....with awesome images on this calendar each month......so pretty of it and I loved it too..
9677	2	a	This app sucks for my 3 year old it dosent even tell her what animal she is putting to gether.
9678	3	a	This app provides a lot of arabic streaming but it crashes frequently when the screen orientation is changed to landescape
9679	3	a	Keeps tell me Not supported...I have an s7...:( downloaded 2 of these apps \nfor fronts neither work on my phone :(
9680	5	a	My motivation to study! When i don't use it, i realise i don't concentrate as much. This app really motivates and helps me to focus.
9681	5	a	My son like it very much
9682	5	a	برنامه بسیار زیبا و عالی هستش واقعا دوسش دارم
9683	5	a	Controls are a little sticky, otherwise it's pretty cool.
9684	5	a	One of best bluetooth earphones . Fm radio, reads your text messages, id's calls ,2device hook up , good battery life. Samsung should of come out with this instead of expensive watch!!! This is only $60 bucks.
9685	1	a	I previously purchased this with Google Play.  But now when I attempt to apply it, it's asking me to pay with GetJar.
9686	4	a	"  it will be nice with csipsimple support :)"""
9687	1	a	Just delete your app dude
9688	5	a	When are the next levels coming out?

9690	2	a	I don't know why does he kill me
9691	3	a	Sometimes it works flawlessly, but more often, it crashes in the middle of streaming, or it just hangs and never loads.
9692	3	a	It's ok, basic atlas map
9693	2	a	There's no song and boring
9694	4	a	I am an avid player of this game and have been using the Apple app. for years.  I have consistently notice that for Arkham encounters that app. will give you only 8-10 different encounters as if the randomization algorithm was not given too much thought.  This app. seems much more random, costs $20 less presuming you get it for all the sets, and has a much faster layout.  Thank you for making this!  After a few games of use, this app seems to also have randomization issues; same encounters ~15% of the time.
9695	2	a	Winning, takes to, long to, get ahead! I have, been babying, to long. Uninstalling! To many, adds! Nice, graphics. It's, not keeping, my interest, any longer.
9696	3	a	I haven't used it yet to no how much it works.
9697	3	a	As below, has now disappeared on my tablet
9698	4	a	Sip nih akhirnya bisa lagi dibuka setelah ads nya di ilangin..... Kembali 4 bintang + 2 jempol....

9702	5	a	The most epic evolution game ever
9703	1	a	It is diffucult to make any sense of this app; epecially when the language preference is set to English and every thing comes up Vietnamese. Also Kanji do not appear on the screen. This app needs alot of work. Uninstalling ASAP.
9704	1	a	Rate      this     game
9705	3	a	Застрягло на з'єднанні з сервером.

9710	5	a	Very good for my lovely daughter.
9711	4	a	So far so good for me!
9712	4	a	Why don't you   separate the teams into there leagues and have all clubs apart from that I would give it 5 stars!
9713	1	a	ايري ب ام هل نكت البايخة على ام هل برنامج الخرا
9714	1	a	Just played the app and the game only lets you make a bracket and you can only use 3 letters idk what this game wants the money for but don't waste your money on a stupid game
9715	2	a	The info. Is not up to date and not complete such as the terminal #. And \nthe delais
9716	1	a	Most battery widgets have no permissions, why does this?
9717	1	a	The game has only 19 levels. Level 20 is unpassable
9718	1	a	Hate it, it doesn't do what it says it does.It only put's a weird filter on the image when you choose a colour.
9719	1	a	I downloaded it but I can't find it anywhere.
9720	1	a	To many adverts can't even do anything its ###### rubbish.
9721	5	a	People think I'm crazy, because I see things the way a wolf does, I am so bonded with this animal, I feel like I am one of them...I wish I was though, this app is amazing! And I hope you, who is reading this, have the wolf guide you through your dreams
9722	5	a	Can you watch the games on his app ??
9723	4	a	All is good but is there a human version
9724	5	a	Can u guys add like a bird that flies around and wen it eats it just pecks on the ground please!!!! AWESOME GAME BTW \u003c33333
9725	5	a	this app is awesome. !
9726	5	a	Source of getting complete news
9727	4	a	brilliant app only problem Is staff not adding points on after scanning my phone. also the sub squad seems pointless as you don't seem to get any extra points and the bonus point's seem unusable
9728	4	a	Been using this app off and on for two years,  had great weight loss at the beginning and was able to reach my goals.   But, must be consistent or will see a slower weight loss  progress. This app is great because 1) can select different food items to your likings. 2) the meal plan are simple and easy to make. 3) don't be hungry with six small meals.
9729	3	a	It's great but it keeps crashing while playing
9730	5	a	Epic wallpaper, but doesn't fit right on my Note 3. Wallpaper doesn't fill screen. Excellent though,  wish it had fit
9731	5	a	Pilihan yang bagus untuk semua orang
9732	3	a	Wish it had a remember me option and really dislike having to go to home screen to exit the app. Other than those two issues thd app is fine.
9733	1	a	You can't even aim properly
9734	5	a	I love this app. You can adjust many settings to your satisfaction. The best thing is it gives you remaining time for a salat. Qibla directions are accurate. Also, Azan variations and silencing options during salat time are greatly appreciable. Thank you very much for developing such a good application. Jazak Allah. One thing that I would like to suggest is that all the features in your 'other' section are only in Arabic. It would be nice if English translation is also available.
9735	1	a	Horrible.... How do you expect me to play this thing when the is 👶'Princess New Baby'👶 but the birthing level is locked. What I remember is that I only take care of the pregnant princess👸, Checking up the pregnant princess👸. So annoying🙅. Please fix it 😛😛😛😛😛😛😛😛😛😛
9736	4	a	Great game, really love it, i only have the issue with depth. For instance it is hard to see the slopes and staircases with the current angle of the level. It just looks like the ball stops having physics by rolling up a hill with no momentum. This and when you go off of an elevated platform it looks like you should go at an angle but you would need to go straight which is visually confusing.
9737	3	a	It's calculations aren't always correct. I ended up with a win of 500 coins and it never added up. The bells kept ringing.
9738	5	a	Po n ga da oru nalla gamae kanndupiinga
9739	1	a	I created an account 2 weeks ago and I am still unable to log into my \naccount using this app. I have no problem logging into Sunny Portal on a \nregular PC web browser, ergo my conclusion that this app has major issues. \nI may re-evaluate my review if I can finally log in with the App.
9740	2	a	Well done. However, take time to cross check the flags and capitals. For \nexample, the flag of India has been allotted to Nigeria. This is a huge \nerror. Well done again.
9741	1	a	Points to different areas when locating north.
9742	1	a	The main ADW Launcher received an update, after 5 years, to 2.0 beta. There is a new in app purchase option for users of ADW Launcher 2.0 beta to upgrade to ex. However, existing ex owners are required to repurchase in order to unlock full functionality again. It might not be an issue for some, but at least now you know this is the developers business model. Had I known that application updates would require repurchase of the application, I may have chosen differently in the past.
9743	5	a	nice app to learn dance moves
9744	5	a	I like it, it's really funny.
9745	5	a	I remember the old board game battleship. This one step better. Wayhay.
9746	1	a	It was great for the two days while it worked, but it stopped functioning for seemingly no reason. It was convenient to have my scedule available to me. I hope that this problematic app gets fixed soon
9747	5	a	Good improvement in logistics arrangements
9748	5	a	This game is vary fun to play, I couldn't put my tablet down. In just two days I passed almost all the levels, and gotten 3 stars on all of them. I even unlock all of the battleships, this is a very interesting game. One problem on the other hand is that the missiles don't operate very well. I saw few missiles targeting the enemy plane, but most of them targets enemy battleships. Which make it easy for the incoming plane to destroy my battleship.
9749	5	a	Best app and really working.
9750	3	a	I agree with andrea mason that it should have free fly mode
9751	5	a	Está nova versão está muito mais alinhada com o que seria de esperar de um banco online. Tira partido das novas vantagens dos dispositivos móveis. Recomendado!
9752	5	a	Have downloaded this and many others just like it. Very addictive, love playing it, great game
9753	1	a	THIS IS SO STUPID!!!!! I WILL NEVER GET THIS APP OR ANYTHING LIKE IT EVER AGAIN.. IT DOES NOT LET YOU TAP AT ALL AND IT TO OK AWAY 15689 HITS WHEN I EXITED THE APP IT ALSO AL MOST GAVE ME A VIRUS THAN KS TO MY EXTRA SECURE VIRUS CHECKER IT FAILED THANK GOD
9754	5	a	Just one thing....the BGM payed during the player's defeat......that's the only thing that makes me think about some kind of sad moments in RPG game such as FF instead of Ace Combat. But overall it's good,so I got no complaints at all. XD
9755	3	a	Why your family can't hunt? Why u have to find your family members? Why u can't fish? Spinos eat fish! And there's no way to make allies! Psssh!
9756	5	a	Nice work. Plz add some more in blue color. Bored of default green.
9757	1	a	Good application but each time when we feed data it gives the message app. unfortunately it stops working
9758	1	a	I love very much there were so much cute pictures
9759	4	a	Actually a really great app with the whole functionality of the OpenOfficeSuite for Computers. Works fine just VERY slow at times. That's why I subtracted 1 star.
9760	1	a	Way to fast and handling is terrible
9761	2	a	Log in to the web page from my phone.Many of the models do not work, the calander, the business card scanner is no bueno, adding contacts and organizations is an issue.  Basically it comes down to a untested app released into the market.  With no ability to search for contacts names in the calender module how am I supposed to use it for instance.   Might as
9762	2	a	Crashes every time I try to reply through it.  Uninstalled!
9763	3	a	I have played this game for  3yrs at least. I bought the game recently. Bad part is the only money I spent in all the the play for devlopeers that is.  I got everything in the game for nothin '. Devlopeers must think we have xray vision and ESP the view is Bad Countless of times,  get an achievement sign pops up in line of sight. Power up show right when a car is about to go over it and cars have no blickers pull right in front of you, no way to avoid hitting.  This is a good game fix it, make it Great!
9764	1	a	Uninstalling! I dont know how to use the filter form
9765	4	a	Lots of fun! Great game for everyone! Love their games! Keep the fun coming!
9766	2	a	This does not have cloud saving? I lost my data after i uninstalling! Developers are dead!
9767	2	a	The controls.on the fox are messed up.E.x:I turn right and I go straight
9768	5	a	Самые классные живые обои из тех что я пока видел. Потрясающе. Спасибо.
9769	4	a	I'd give 5 stars if the viewing was more optimised, I could disable dictionaries, or if it had search history.
9770	5	a	My daughter loves these games
9771	1	a	Rubbish app! Don't bother. Couldn't get the app to work, so had to call for a taxi. They then charged me twice!
9772	5	a	I gave 4 to older version.nice update now I increased my rating to 5
9773	5	a	Best flashcard app ever. Could work on translations a little but still awesome.
9774	1	a	Worked great until a few months ago.  Now won't show updates from the ones I selected.  Also shows me updates from people I've clicked no to countless times.  Fix it please or I'm deleting!
9775	5	a	i like this type of games , nice work   it remembering me by supermario
9776	4	a	SHARKZ thanks for playing, dont forget to rate the game 5 stars and download games from our advertizers : Test your reaction time in this stunning addictive 3D infinite Swimmer game, You are the last megalodon, a prehistoric distant cousin of the sharks today, museums and zoos have put a big price on your head.. Dead or Alive, Avoiding coral rocks and torpedo fire while stacking up your score streaks your Shark takes flight, swimming day and night over coral reefs and through the crags of the briney deeps, eat the fish to increase your streak, bigger streaks make your score multiply eating fish will stop you starving to death, the more you eat the longer you play!! watch out for the marine biologists in their submarines,
9777	2	a	It won't even open anymore.  Paid money for an app that won't open.
9778	1	a	" then you have to call the bank back to get your password reset. at least thats what i got from the bank. Dont waste your F N time with this app!!"""
9779	5	a	Very nice App for quotes on Father's Day. Could use more of a selection.
9780	1	a	I have to get go weather and I tryed and it still does not work
9781	1	a	Constant notifications for ads made me delete the app. Don't download it :(
9782	3	a	I don't know if this is the app's problem or not, but often when I try to backspace something, the word just copies itself more and more. Also, the layout could be improved a bit more in my opinion.
9783	3	a	I would love it if it were more like Skee Ball,with barriers around it to bounce off of,with this the ball falls down and you get no points,makes it harder to get higher points,and there is only 10 balls,could give more,like 5 more,it would be a lot more fun that way,because it gets boring after a little while,sorry to say,that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it.
9784	3	a	Good app but no explanation as ti function of buttons, with a bit of fiddling round you will get there.
9785	1	a	So far I hate this version of the app. Every since I have updated the app, \nit has not been able to load onto the sign on page. Very frustrating. The \nold version worked just fine. I don't know why I was suggested to update a \nworse version of something that I had that was working correctly. \nRidiculous. Makes no sense at all. Uninstalling NOW!!
9786	1	a	but this free app sucks!!!! 5 stars for Bacon 1 for the app
9787	5	a	It's very fun to play this game.might get confused at first tho
9788	4	a	Each song verse repeats endlessly until you go to the next screen.  My 1.5 year old didn't seem to mind, but it got old quickly for me.
9789	5	a	I've tried several winter live wallpapers, and this is, by far, the best! Beautiful scenes to choose from. At times, I take a few moments and watch the scene on a blank screen without apps. Very relaxing! :)
9790	3	a	The app does not retain song order in the playlist, after adding to the queue. To reproduce this issue, ooen your playlist, add to queue, play, exit, reopen the app check queue, my playlist had s8 songs from rig veda albums
9791	5	a	This an awesome application for your wallpaper problem.
9792	2	a	This is definitely not working with MI Home, the hot spots just disapears behind the launcher or something, i really want a sidebar but it seams no one is working with MI Home, is this something you could workout together? i would like to have my running apps in a sidebar which would be great for task switching.
9793	1	a	I have linked to my steam account and can log into the dockets.dyinglightgame site with no problem, but the app just doesn't allow a connection.  I thought it was me so have changed the password twice. Still cannot connect . Anybody else got problems using a steam linked account?
9794	4	a	It works cleanly and fairly well but it's extremely lacking in configuration for an app that's otherwise designed to provide fluid interaction with the user.
9795	5	a	🌹With 📿hearing the 🛐prayers, it 🕊reminds me that 🎋joy when I was in my  🎑primary... 🎓
9796	1	a	ittin bonnaa Afaan kennaf Addaa kennaa yomiyyuu. ba'ee itti gamaddee
9797	1	a	The one thing I have hope it would have was a way to store your notes linked to the app on cloud! It would make switching devices much more easy. Being able to store bookmarks and favourites online to would help. I wanna be able to sync!
9798	5	a	best launcher ever love it 🌠
9799	5	a	Yes this is very beautiful wallpaper
9800	1	a	Had the clock on my desktop and it doesn't update. I had my screen on and it was correct. Screen off for a few minutes, opened screen again and time hadn't changed.  Emailed dev twice but no response. Very poor all round. Seems like others have had the same issue.
9801	2	a	I would give this a higher rating if it would let you use it on a hd nook!! Bought gogo and a tablet for daughter for Christmas stupid app isn't compatible
9802	5	a	Loved this game but wish some more levels
9803	1	a	It need more levels and more time fix it
9804	5	a	I liked it very much.......
9805	1	a	A directory full of pictures shows up as empty. Crap uninstall
9806	2	a	Good upgrade but now it wont let me open it i have to look for it in my play store app listing so i can access to it
9807	3	a	لە text correction وشەی پێش نیار پشان نادان لە کاتی نوسین تێک چوە
9808	4	a	Overall an enjoyable game.  My only issues are that: 1) there is no true point to the missions except get points for more planes. 2) there should be some realism to the aerodynamics. 3) there should be flaps and speed/gear brakes to help slow and stop on short landing areas (especially with bigger planes).
9809	5	a	This is a nice theme.
9810	4	a	Great for people working towards grammar schools. Could the Webrich Software people answer my question? Could you please teach the people using this app how to do the maths before they start the test?  Yr5 student
9811	2	a	it's so monotonous n lacking interest
9812	5	a	Great game!   Pros: great thinking game with lots of replay value.  Cons: may have a bit of a glitch/flash when touching the colors. Nothing big, just annoying sometimes.
9813	5	a	I can pay more it.
9814	1	a	I jumped over the logs and there was a hole unfair
9815	1	a	desde que fiz o update tem retirado saldo diariamente sem que faça qualquer acesso... nada fazem para resolver o problema nem me deixa desinstalar..  Bruno Costa galaxy ace
9816	1	a	I clicked on said 404 not found
9817	1	a	Doesn't work on Galaxy S4. Just get a monster eating letters then go to a black screen with music forever. Lame.
9818	1	a	Uninstall zbog notifikacija koje se ne mogu iskljuciti.
9819	1	a	Pages don't load correctly, and even after putting my details in I'm locked out until nine more people in my neighborhood join.  No I'm not inviting my contacts or sharing on your behalf, this just makes me want to uninstall.
9820	2	a	When I try to open it I just won't open please fix! And also everyone  is right please update this to be a totally  free game and make it work on Samsung tablets and I will very much recommend  it and give it five stars
9821	5	a	It is a Fun Brain challenging game at a moderate level. It took me less than an hour to beat all 60 puzzles with 180/180 Stars, but fun nonetheless. More levels please.
9822	5	a	When I saw it said-it work with flipaclip i was like i have to download it
9823	5	a	Fun and entertaining relaxes your mind and exitens  your heart
9824	1	a	Great game but will not launch on my new Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Just a black screen.
9825	5	a	Like It. useful and adfree
9826	1	a	Couldn't login with the correct info.
9827	1	a	Same as below review, been using app for years. Now daft page comes up saying register for new app, which if you do tells you your an existing customer and the continue app button, doesnt work. Shambolic to say the least uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times same thing!!. So much for Cooperative getting with the times...
9828	5	a	Hey nice dubstep i could even do it perfectly...but could you add marshmello's song like alone please that would be so cool!
9829	5	a	Waooooooo Very simple but great its awesome ,amazing love it. no match for this
9830	4	a	Really it should have more then three selections of mud bogs that you don't have to pay for cause my parents are all  scared to do it and their credit card will be hacked wouldn't cause no one wants to pay I mean its pretty stupid that they looer you in with a free game to buy most of the mudbogs
9831	5	a	At last I found it..thank n thank
9832	4	a	Very  useful for health records
9833	2	a	Game still need a lot of work. Dont waste your time in downloading it.
9834	3	a	Love it a lot, but hate the fact that every time you return to the menu an ad pops up from game over in hopping . Really kills the fun
9835	1	a	They use it to track your every move and use that information against you to fire you
9836	1	a	Every time you think that it will load it.       Will say error.
9837	4	a	it very fentestic I really like it   THANK YOU SO MUCH
9838	5	a	افضل تطبيقات اخبار كرة القدم هلى الاطلاق بصراحة برنامج عربي ممتاز فاق جميع التوقعات شكرا لجميع طاقم العمل الخلاق وللامام.
9839	1	a	Couldn't use it. Won't let me upload my image to edit. And if its not the slowest app ever, its got more ads than a newspaper. Total trash.
9840	5	a	My daughter love it so much
9841	5	a	I own a few games like this for my computer and now I can play in the go
9842	2	a	I really dislike how the pictures can't be square, I think that should be an option because it stretches the picture which is bad enough, being that I have an irregularly large forehead.... Sadly. Gave it 2 stars because forehead is not your fault, but will rate higher when square photos come out...
9843	3	a	Works great but I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 because I am not able to delete recent call records that the app maintains.. If this is how it is I will be uninstalling soon. I don't need permanent record of my phone calls.
9844	5	a	Fixed the crashing problem now I can play.
9845	4	a	Just a request,is it possible if the messages can customized too?SMS I mean..thanks!!
9846	5	a	Really gold for thd price.Add a bigger map and ur babys grow and for quetcosaurus they fly high and blood but its really good I bought velociraptor, eagle and croc hoping to get shark and add same for them thx
9847	2	a	App not downloading nor previewing anything. Had to uninstall.
9848	5	a	Im living in a hot area so I love coldness and Go sms pro! Its realy cold!
9849	3	a	I've loved this game for years, but lately the ads have become so disruptive I'll probably uninstall it. The worst one is sending you out to a bogus website for a free iPhone (yeah right). Totally blew it, guys.
9850	2	a	I is not as good as the normal 5NAF. But still i found it hard to breath while playing, it makes the game even more spooky being able to walk around. Hate how there is lots of little white dots on the screen. Cant find anything! Looked around whole pizzeria, and can't even find 1 animatronic!!
9851	2	a	Fungerar inte med viss hårdvara, vilket borde vara lätt att ordna, tycker man. Dessutom borde appen även finnas på WP8.
9852	4	a	Application works fine with Samsung A7 2017 (Android 7.0 November 2017 build) BUT the RAW file size (file format I am most interested in) is 0 bytes. The corresponding JPG is 30 MB on average.  I will increase my rating once the raw file size issue is fixed.
9853	4	a	I really enjoy this game. There's less to do which kinda sucks a little. But it won't let me do anything on my game menu. No crossbreading. It just shuts down the game \u0026 I return to my apps screen... EVERYTIME....
9854	5	a	And it's free looks great nice
9855	5	a	Got my original widget back!
9856	1	a	No se que paso pero ya no quiere acceder, por favor arrenglenlo
9857	3	a	Hooray it is working again. Good job mate!
9858	2	a	The game lagged at first, and then it turned black, and went to my home screen. My favorite animal is a wolf, but I can't play the game. Please fix. I use an android LG. I will rate five stars if you fix this. Please fix. I really want to play this game.
9859	5	a	I am disabled and in considerable pain and my memory is compromised as a result.  I need a shopping app that can list by store and has widgets so I can see what I need at a glance. This one fires on all cylinders. WELL DONE, FOLKS!!
9860	4	a	I love this keyboard. I had to say that, but the Spanish pack is a little bit poor. Most of the times it will choose as first option words that don't even exist on Spanish! Is there a way to customize it? Maybe a way to delete words we don't really use in Spanish? That would be great!
9861	1	a	Works good, but cannot be use in indonesia, blocked, paid premium, useless
9862	4	a	Enjoyed the data collection (formulas) and most of the delivery process (user interface). Some of the fonts need interpretation to determine their symbolic nature, so the formulas fit.
9863	1	a	This program is too chatty. E G creating and saving a small text file - Do you want to save? Do you want to save here? Which file name?
9864	2	a	The game is really fun when I can play. Sometimes the controls stop working but the controls aren't that good anyways. Also the health needs more. I only get touched my three guys and the loser screen appears. I think it should take at least 7 guys to kill me.
9865	1	a	Won't buy most books. I just went through my tiny collection of 50+ books to see what it would say and for the few it even recognized it said they aren't buying. Many of mine are older books so it didn't find them. Uninstalling. If they only want textbooks they should say so, and be warned: you'll get more selling it back to a used book store.
9866	2	a	Poorly written... Same reading no matter what cards you get... Wants money.
9867	1	a	Won't let me do anything
9868	5	a	அருமையான எழுத்தாணி Application. மிகவும்.பயணுள்ளதாக. உள்ளது. நன்றி .❤❤❤❤
9869	1	a	This stupid app took me from sunny side all the way to meyerland when all i \nwanted to do was go to s post oak
9870	5	a	The effects are awesome.Im a huge hunter fanatic it's the best wallpaper I've ever had in my life.
9871	4	a	It is very clear and cool, it does however show up stretched on Note 5. It would be nice to see animation smoothness settings available as well.
9872	5	a	अच्छी जानकारी है जो आज के पीढ़ी के लिए जरूरी भी है ।
9873	4	a	Everything is good..But some EMU train timings are missing in the schedule.... Please clear this issue \u0026 release the new version ASAP.. Thankyou
9874	4	a	I like it, but I am having an issue on purchasing. I am trying to purchase the Gold membership with 1000gold. It says P200. I have P207 on my account but it always say that I dont have enough credits on my account. Please help.
9875	3	a	after initial startup screen. Note3
9876	5	a	i like this one.. ;)
9877	5	a	Hey, those who say these things to ya, don't pay attention. You rock and this game is just wow!!
9878	1	a	The notes aren't any any good. It sounds like is has a mute on it.
9879	5	a	Very..very useful apps.. Highly recommended
9880	5	a	A versão anterior não funcionava direito, mas essa é muito legal
9881	5	a	It is adorable i love it!. One problem though is that trying to gt the upgraded version isnt working. I click it and it doesnt do anything at all. Can you please tell me how to fix that, and or fix that?
9882	3	a	It's ok just 3 problems unlock all blocks for free and put it online but just not facebook and add doors then I will rate 5 stars
9883	4	a	Good app,  Try to sort the photos in album in the descending order of the dates so that most recently clicked photos appeare first in the list...
9884	4	a	A little bit expensive for what you get to be honest, 4 stars only for that reason, but I've been using this for a very long time after jumping around from one tracker to another. Everything you need, absolutely nothing you don't. Getting gdrive sync out of an experimental state would be great.
9885	3	a	I can't get it out. I have done every thing they said to do and still it won't work. I a very up set..
9886	5	a	I love it. Keeps me updated on the euro.
9887	5	a	Very easy and straight forward way to manage all of you notifications in one place. I like the option of multiple profiles and the ability to automatically disable notifications on newly installed apps. And the best part it that it is free and there are no ads. This dev really did a great job. It is the best notification app available.  So what are you waiting for already... Install it, you won't regret it.
9888	1	a	I put 44 litres of fuel in the Compact, the app says I paid 5,936.60£ ? Tis now, uninstalled so it is.
9889	4	a	Simply time killer. EDIT : Where's my achievements? I had finished the Architecture pack with PRO settings and to my dismay none was recorded on the achievement roster!
9890	1	a	I paid the 99 cents to remove ads but the ads are still there. There is no point to this app if ads are popping up. Ruins the intended result.
9891	1	a	It is a boring game.  When we start the game it should be written unfortunately car parking 4d is stopped. Please don't download this game. I hat this game very much
9892	4	a	It would help to have a description of what circumstances you would use each knot.  Not all of the knots are free but it is one of the better knot tying apps I've seen
9893	4	a	Зургын цомог гэж алдсаныг эс тооцвол гоё апп байна.
9894	2	a	I don't understand it. I got to a part of the story with an ending, but it says I finished with a 100% fear rating, but when I check, it's only like 65%
9895	5	a	U can put lots of pics together and it doesn't make it difficult to write u can add stickers and all
9896	5	a	I like how clean and quick the interface is. My zoo is listed! Can't wait to track myself when I get there.
9897	5	a	You didn't keep me Long to get your Loan it's fast and convenient thanks to \nsaida app loan
9898	1	a	Stops all the time and can't play without Uninstall ingredients it then reinstalling it every couple days. Getting to be a real pain. Guess I'll have to find a different solitiare to play!
9899	1	a	I saw the reviews of the earlier version that said it wouldn't work on the Samsung Epic (Galaxy S) but was hoping when I saw that the latest update included compatibility improvement that it might work. I'm sad to report that it doesn't. The screen remains black. However if you freeze the frame you can see what the camera was pointed at in that instant.
9900	1	a	This game is ridiculous, you start out with very few blocks and most of them are locked. And then you can barely move around good, plus you can't really do ANYTHING. But that's not all, it tells you how good the game is when you look at the pictures but its a really horrible game. Plz look at all the reviews to see what people posted and what their opinions are. Thx
9901	5	a	I love this app. This is alwsome
9902	3	a	They want you to buy the top tier weapons even after you spend forever leveling up.  What a crock of bs ...
9903	2	a	Crashes when trying to set ringtone
9904	5	a	Although only info for specific station.this app gives extremly accurate info on bus arrival times for most bus routes.
9905	1	a	It is very very boring
9906	4	a	Great didn't expect that it would be fast and no lag in it ^.^ love the graphics too ! And it's such an easy addictive game too.
9907	2	a	Game was great doesn't seem to work now. I'm on Android 7 with Galaxy s7 edge....please fix issues
9908	5	a	My daughter and me love the colors and she loves the dresses I'm so glad we got it! Bit the only thing wrong is we have to pay to get all the locked stuff!
9909	5	a	Five star private safety app huawei ascend y330 only
9910	1	a	Just worked on a document with this app.. went to save the document to my Google Drive..  the document did NOT save to my drive.  the application opened a dialog box giving me the option to send the document in email form, warning me the changes may not save to drive.  so i chose yes, i wanted to email it to myself.  THEN THE APPLICATION CLOSED.  completely wasted more than an hour working on this GROUP project that is due this evening.    I DO NOT recommend using this application.  It is not consistent.
9911	3	a	It's a good concept but the playing field is way too small. I kept fighting with the 3 tiny gems to try \u0026 get them to turn  \u0026 when they did turn they turned the wrong way. All well. Uninstalled-too much of a pain to play.
9912	3	a	Can't move to SD card? HTC EVO
9913	5	a	It's a very good app it's very helpful
9914	2	a	2x updates every day but cannot connect to server everytime. It was too good to be true, I really thought it's great like the PC version.
9915	5	a	I like hazel she is so cute put I don't like her sound like lllaallalla but I rate her 5 star
9916	3	a	needs to have harder answers you can easily choose an answer with how off the other answers are from the correct one
9917	1	a	Lo único que hace es abrir la web en el browser del móvil. Completamente inútil.
9918	5	a	Use 2 love this game \u0026 Then you go \u0026 kill it. Thanks guys,no really thanks. Last update done it ages ago.download 2try.still not working thanks again.
9919	4	a	This app help for me.
9920	1	a	They go to a white page with colorful script that says kids lab and just stays there and shows me ad over and over
9921	5	a	Great app for discovering new Indian muaic
9922	5	a	This app has warnings that look way too suited for armed robbery, it's very useful and handy. I wish it had an auto play or repeat button though
9923	5	a	Its great and iys looks likevur on a real rollercoaster!!! Via HTC
9924	5	a	good tool, accurate enough for my application (which way is north roughly). woupd uae for other applicsyions ig i didnt have compass available
9925	5	a	Rly i lv dis theme
9926	1	a	Don't waste your mb on a dumb game that doesn't even open up. That's just sad 😔
9927	5	a	As advertised the app provides a widget that show a different time in the world. It's great for contacting family abroad.
9928	5	a	It helps me to figure out if I'm alert enuff to go on with my day😋! If I \nmiss a lot I go back to sleep for a couple more hours!
9929	1	a	After in installation it is not open in my phone this is very poor service
9930	2	a	nice... but it just gobles up space (over 2gig) and there doesn't seem to be an easy way to purge the old files...
9931	5	a	She's so hot I want to kiss and merry her and eat her booby  And dick
9932	5	a	Coolest app!initially had problem figuring out how to add friends,but other than that,its nice.although customizable themes would make it cooler.
9933	1	a	It's a very useless app
9934	5	a	Feel so much deference in just 1st week.. too much exellent
9935	1	a	Only name displayed but doesn't appeaering
9936	3	a	Don't really like the new keyboard look. Go back to the old ones..
9937	5	a	I use it on my mobile games it so good
9938	3	a	When other people say this game is really short, they mean it. The actual game is short it just takes a while to select the right options to finish the game. It is frustrating, the constant restarting and rereading the same story over and over again. Ending is slightly anticlimatic but still worth playing. Not as good as others in the series. Also how is an Irishman outside the walls of Christian society?
9939	3	a	Some of the letters are wrong so I wouldn't know the how to really write something in hieroglyphs.
9940	3	a	Easy to use and already copy in clipboard. Love!! (*^ーﾟ)b ｸﾞｯｼﾞｮﾌﾞ!!
9941	4	a	Please add more cars and levels and i will give you 5 stars.
9942	2	a	Sorry but the android version isn't equipped with the gumroad store as well as no option to arrange your collection... after some research it seems the apple version has more features. Frankly, it feels unfair and lackluster.
9943	4	a	Would like the ability to remove the pan/scan/zoom etc buttons as unnecessary with static cameras,  to create more screen space. But works great  over LAN (use 192.168.X.X) or 3g (use your 'what is my IP' address)  or set up a static IP from dyndns etc)
9944	1	a	This game is not my kind maybe look at turbos rockets dog game it's amazing maybe that will give you ideas ok
9945	1	a	Могли б что-нибудь повеселей придумать.
9946	5	a	This is a great app, worth every cent of the 99 pennies it cost! Only problem, the Colt 1851 Navy featured in the app is not an 1851 Navy, it is actually the 1861 Navy. Besides that, it's a fun app to mess around with. These guys do quality work!
9947	2	a	I would not give this game a three stars. All I could do is walk around.
9948	1	a	Gaurav d patel R.I.P. (1974-2015)
9949	5	a	It is the bestest and very funny and so easy to play
9950	2	a	Please help, I cannot KEEP my collection,,
9951	1	a	Sence I got almost as much ads as there is play time. Uninstalling NOW!!!!
9952	1	a	I downloaded this coz I got a sony bluetooth headset to connect to my lg g2 phone but for some reason it won't even detect the headset! It detects my laptop hp though so the app works.but not to its own product lol what is the point of this app seriously?
9953	1	a	Estão fazendo tudo para obrigar a pagar mensalidade no R7 Play. Estratégia de marketing para povão ! Ilusão quem pensa que há algo grátis na TV Brasileira...
9954	5	a	I love it it's like a first spinner!!!!  We'll done!
9955	1	a	U can just use the app pics art plus its not good quality when the photo is done
9956	3	a	Force choose when push play or freezes phone and I have to pull the battery and restart the phone. I'd like to try this game. Hopefully it'll work soon.
9957	4	a	I've finally got to level 81 like most people impossible to pass.  I'm keeping the game and just go back to level 81 . Hopefully sometime this year I might get past level 81.
9958	1	a	Plz fix my game I tried buying the stadium map with the same amount then tapped the map it didn't even buy it
9959	2	a	"For starters items \pitched\"" are thrown from the side of screen. And the items are thrown at a rather quick pace.                                                        Lastly this could have been a great game but someone didn't see the ball coming from the side."""
9960	2	a	I tried installing and uninstalling twice, it doesn't appear on my smartwatch neither my smart connect.
9961	1	a	The bike started going backwards. dont spoil the name of the original roadrash
9962	1	a	اجبهم منين ياغبي طب اكتب حاجة عنهم في الدسكربشن ... ابلكشن غبي زي صاحبة
9963	1	a	3rd level is so hard you son of a batch my battery almost died
9964	1	a	Constantly crashing, won't let you upload additional faces for other (4) dancers. Can't save or share. What's the use?
9965	4	a	Neat, simple game with Roguelike gameplay. It's a grinding game, there's no way to beat it without repeating the same thing over and over again until you're strong enough. Sometimes boring, but easy to pick up and play for a moment. Would be more interesting if it were faster paced.
9966	1	a	Was working great but unfortunately the grey background has made a return. I open the app and all I get is the grey background.
9967	4	a	The topics should be organised  properly, to prevent zig zag reading... the app is very good
9968	5	a	All basic word that we all use in everyday life and it show how to write it with prononciation.
9969	1	a	Waste.. ! Videos r so dark and no preview.suddenly saved or not saved
9970	5	a	This is a really great and funny game, but i would like it more if it had a Mordis with the Cantabrian Labaro
9971	1	a	Don't bother downloading this it says they deactivated the mobile website but on other apps they let you sign into the proper website to check the team anyway. Not on this one though a message appears saying it's a bug. The other websites take less memory space also. Imho a 1 star rating is too kind for this app that refused to open before I found out you can't sign into the website, just a complete disaster.
9972	4	a	I like it and all, but when I watch ads for coins, 90% of the time they \nself-click, is anyone else having this problem? Because I'm pretty sure \nself-clicking ads are illegal.
9973	3	a	It doesn't work for Samsung galaxy j7
9974	3	a	All u do is rub
9975	5	a	Great shaders i use HQx4 and no lag. Not to mention that you can actually see a big difference. I havent experienced any lag maybe its just peoples phones. But absolutely love playing pokemon rom hacks on HQx4!
9976	5	a	This is a cool game I love it:-)
9977	5	a	Like this theme for this Valentine's

9980	4	a	Need to be in the right frame of mind but great for the brain
9981	5	a	Bst app ever had it jst make amazing pics I m really impressed \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3
9982	1	a	bad developer , if one start clicking on the tab he has given here unless ball stops where do you have time to place bets. atleast he should have common sense. waste app
9983	5	a	congrats on all the success of Flappy Bird. i really do cringe at all the idiots praising its originality.
9984	4	a	It is a little hard but I like that, and the pug is so ADORABLE🐶 but my only concern is that the app keeps playing the music when I hit the home button or turn off the screen, I have to go into full exit button and swipe it away , I just don't like that it keeps running and playing the music when the screen is OFF .  FIX THIS PLEASE!!!😨😱
9985	4	a	This is a good game but when I attack it gliches

9995	1	a	Why even make a game for kids about kissing??
9996	1	a	I think its best with deerhunter2014 But how can any one like this game its only wast of time. Pooooor grapic and full with numbers of adds.
9997	2	a	The idea of converting android device into USB keyboard/mouse struck on my mind, so I just googled it..i found this app, but I'm disappointed...
9998	5	a	I really enjoyed this app I prayed everyday it helps me get my day started I thank God for this app
